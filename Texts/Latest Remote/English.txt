RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_0_0
TEXT: Hello there, %PLAYERNAME%! Look around—have you ever seen so many Bulbasaur?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_0_1
TEXT: Personally, I’ve only witnessed a gathering like this once before. It was some time ago, and there were so many Trainers out and about catching all the little Seed Pokémon they could find.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_0_2
TEXT: In fact, seeing all these Bulbasaur has me feeling quite nostalgic!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_0_3
TEXT: It also reminded me of an important scientific tenet: there’s always more to learn! And I never tire of researching Pokémon, no matter the species.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_0_4
TEXT: In that spirit, what do you say we do some research on Bulbasaur, Trainer?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, Trainer. That’s a downright adorable Bulbasaur you’ve caught!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_1_1
TEXT: Did you know that Bulbasaur uses the nutrients that are stored in the seed on its back to grow?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_1_2
TEXT: I’d love to have a built-in snack backpack. It would keep my stomach quiet in the field, that’s for sure! Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_1_3
TEXT: As you may know, Bulbasaur’s Evolution—Ivysaur—gains strength when it’s exposed to sunlight.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_1_4
TEXT: That sunlight also makes the bud on its back grow larger. It would be lovely to witness that phenomenon myself, for old time’s sake.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_1_5
TEXT: While you go off and evolve your Bulbasaur, I’ll continue following this pack of Bulbasaur I’ve been observing. They appear to be on the move!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_2_0
TEXT: Goodness me, look at the size of that Ivysaur! Well done, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_2_1
TEXT: If memory serves, the bud on Ivysaur’s back produces a sweet aroma when it starts to swell, indicating the flower’s about to bloom.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_2_2
TEXT: Have you gotten a whiff of that scent yet? If you do, your Ivysaur may be getting ready to evolve!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_2_3
TEXT: Now, remember that pack of Bulbasaur I was following? A handful of Ivysaur have recently emerged from a nearby forest to join them.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_2_4
TEXT: They all seem to be heading in the same direction... But what’s their destination, I wonder? Let’s go see if we can’t dig up some answers, hm?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_3_0
TEXT: Welcome back %PLAYERNAME%. Hold on—is that a Venusaur with you?! It must be my lucky day.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_3_1
TEXT: You see, the Bulbasaur and Ivysaur I was following led me to a grove where a Venusaur was resting. There was an unusual scent in the air that seemed to calm the Pokémon that had gathered.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_3_2
TEXT: I’ve read that Venusaur sometimes produces a scent that attracts other Pokémon, so I surmised that’s what was occurring.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_3_3
TEXT: In fact, the way the Bulbasaur and Ivysaur gathered around Venusaur reminded me of how Lure Modules work to attract Pokémon via scent.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_3_4
TEXT: Now, let’s talk Venusaur. Did you know it can Mega Evolve?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_3_5
TEXT: Take this Venusaur Mega Energy and try Mega Evolving your new friend. You’ll learn more by experiencing Mega Venusaur’s power for yourself!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_3_6
TEXT: There are so many things we can learn from Pokémon, and researching them can lead us to even more exciting discoveries. I hope you enjoyed yourself during today’s scientific excursion!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2021_0_0
TEXT: Hello there, %PLAYERNAME%! We’ve come to the end of the year once again...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2021_0_1
TEXT: And it looks like some familiar Pokémon from earlier this year are reappearing, too!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2021_0_2
TEXT: Do you think they’re here to celebrate the year’s end with us?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2021_0_3
TEXT: I hope you’ll take a moment to reflect on all the ways you’ve grown and the adventures we had these last 12 months.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2021_0_4
TEXT: We achieved the impossible, created legends, and discovered so much about ourselves! Which moment are you most proud of?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2021_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%. Wow, just look at all the Pokémon you’ve caught! Up for another challenge?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2021_1_1
TEXT: Will you evolve a few of them for me? I’d say you’ve evolved plenty yourself, as a Trainer, this year. Especially after all that time with Hoopa.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2021_1_2
TEXT: What mischief it made this year—remember when it summoned all those Legendary Pokémon?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2021_1_3
TEXT: The bond between Trainer and Pokémon can change so much more than just a Pokémon’s appearance.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2021_1_4
TEXT: Just something to think about as you evolve your Pokémon today!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2021_2_0
TEXT: With a new year just around the corner, I can’t help but look back. What can we learn from the histories of places, Pokémon, and our fellow Trainers?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2021_2_1
TEXT: That reminds me—have you heard about the strange door I found recently? I have a feeling we’re in for quite an adventure!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2021_2_2
TEXT: I wonder what mysteries hide behind that door. What can this relic tell us about the past—and our shared future...?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2021_2_3
TEXT: Sorry, where were we? Ah, yes! Be sure to catch lots of Pokémon, study how they evolve, and maybe work on improving your Poké Ball throws, too. Let’s end the year awash in new knowledge!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2021_3_0
TEXT: You’ve made it to the end, %PLAYERNAME%! Here’s a reward for all your hard work. Consider it a token of my gratitude as well, for all you’ve done for me this year.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2021_3_1
TEXT: I look forward to our adventures together next year! Are you ready? Then let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! Quite an eventful few months we’ve had, eh?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_0_1
TEXT: How are things with Hoopa? You two seem to get along great from what I can tell.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_0_10
TEXT: The poem lines up with the fact that Hoopa has multiple forms: Hoopa Confined and Hoopa Unbound.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_0_11
TEXT: What’s more, I feel a sort of...mysterious power emanating from the bottle. The patterns on it seem reminiscent of Hoopa, don’t you think?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_0_12
TEXT: It’s all got me tremendously excited! We’ve been trying to learn more about Hoopa for a while now, and I have a feeling this may be the final piece of the puzzle.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_0_13
TEXT: Naturally, I’ll need your help to put it all together, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_0_14
TEXT: Can you see what you can learn in the field while I stay here to analyze the poem and bottle?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_0_2
TEXT: I suspect its trust in you must have deepened after you protected it from Team GO Rocket.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_0_3
TEXT: While you and Hoopa have been out adventuring together, my research into the mystery surrounding Hoopa has taken some strange turns.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_0_4
TEXT: I was up late poring over my notes recently when I heard a knock at the door of my mobile lab. I certainly wasn’t expecting anyone, but I figured it would be rude not to answer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_0_5
TEXT: As I approached the door, I heard something scurrying away, and when I opened it, I found nothing but a curious bottle at my feet.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_0_6
TEXT: There was a note attached. I’ve managed to decipher only part of it, but here’s what I’ve got so far.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_0_7
TEXT: “Offer sweets and dust you’ve found 
So Hoopa’s form will be unbound

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_0_9
TEXT: Poetry isn’t exactly my forte, but it’s got a pleasant rhyme structure, I’d say!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_1_0
TEXT: Thanks for your help, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_1_1
TEXT: I’ve been busy analyzing the poem and the bottle it came with—and I have something to share!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_1_2
TEXT: The poem seems to be providing hints as to how to change Hoopa’s form—and I believe this bottle is somehow involved in that process.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_1_3
TEXT: With that said, the bottle’s power appears to be dormant. But with more research, I’m confident we can find a way to harness it and change Hoopa’s form!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_1_4
TEXT: After all we’ve overcome to get this far, I have no doubt the two of us can crack this together.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_1_5
TEXT: Will you help me conduct some more research so we can witness Hoopa’s other form?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_2_0
TEXT: Eureka! %PLAYERNAME%, I’ve just had a massive breakthrough.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_2_1
TEXT: Remember this part of the poem? 
“Offer sweets and dust you’ve found 
So Hoopa’s form will be unbound”

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_2_10
TEXT: Hoopa Unbound is said to be tremendously powerful—but I think you can handle it, Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_2_11
TEXT: It’s been a long adventure with Hoopa, but I think we’ve finally reached the end.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_2_12
TEXT: It’s almost bittersweet, don’t you think? But fret not—I’m sure more discoveries await!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_2_13
TEXT: Let’s keep adventuring through this world full of mysteries—you, me, and Hoopa!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_2_2
TEXT: I believe the poem is telling us to use Hoopa Candy and Stardust to change Hoopa’s form!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_2_3
TEXT: You can get Stardust by catching Pokémon and battling in raids, but you can earn Hoopa Candy only by adventuring with Hoopa as your buddy.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_2_4
TEXT: Luckily, I’ve managed to convert the bottle’s power into Hoopa Candy. Once you’ve gathered everything you need, you’ll be able to change your Hoopa Confined into Hoopa Unbound.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_2_5
TEXT: There’s another bit of the poem that I think is relevant here, too.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_2_6
TEXT: “And in this form it shall remain 
Until an offering is made again.”

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_2_7
TEXT: It sounds like you’ll also need Hoopa Candy and Stardust to change Hoopa Unbound back into Hoopa Confined—but something tells me you won’t need quite as much.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_2_8
TEXT: Of course, this is all just a theory.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_2_9
TEXT: We’ll have to test it before reaching any proper conclusions!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_0_0
TEXT: Hi there! It’s so nice to meet you, %PLAYERNAME%. My name is Professor Willow. I’m a Pokémon researcher, and I’ll be guiding you on your journey—and what a journey it shall be!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_0_1
TEXT: You’ll also be helping me with my research along the way. So really, we’re more like colleagues!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_0_2
TEXT: First things first—let’s go over how to catch Pokémon, make a Curveball Throw, and transfer Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_0_3
TEXT: You can catch Pokémon with Poké Balls.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_0_4
TEXT: If you throw a Poké Ball at the center of the Pokémon and time your throw just right, you can even achieve a Nice, Great, or Excellent Throw!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_0_5
TEXT: Curveball Throws are advanced throws that can help you grow even more as a Trainer. To make a Curveball Throw, spin the Poké Ball as you throw it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_0_6
TEXT: It’s OK if you don’t get it at first. That’s what practice is for!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_0_7
TEXT: Once you’ve caught some Pokémon, you can keep them in your Pokémon storage or transfer them to my mobile lab in exchange for Candy.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_0_8
TEXT: I’ll explain more about Candy later. For now, how about you go catch some Pokémon?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_1_0
TEXT: Hello again, %PLAYERNAME%! How was catching Pokémon? Not too bad after the first few tries, right?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_1_1
TEXT: Soon, you’ll be making Excellent Curveball Throws as easily as a Goldeen swims in water!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_1_2
TEXT: Next, I’d like to talk to you about an item that I’ve created called Incense.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_1_3
TEXT: It emits a fragrance that is irresistible to Pokémon, making them come to you, instead of having you go to them! Handy, eh?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_1_4
TEXT: If you know you’re going to be out adventuring for a while, using Incense can really boost the amount of Pokémon you encounter. It’s one of my favorite items.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_1_5
TEXT: Speaking of items, have you heard of Berries? There are several different types that Pokémon enjoy eating, and they each have different effects.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_1_6
TEXT: For example, Nanab Berries calm Pokémon down, making it easier for you to aim a Poké Ball at them.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_1_7
TEXT: How about you give these items a try? Go ahead and use an Incense to attract Pokémon. Then, use Nanab Berries to help you catch them!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_2_0
TEXT: Hello again, %PLAYERNAME%! Great work using Incense and Berries to help you catch Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_2_1
TEXT: If you’re ever running low on Berries or Poké Balls, you can visit PokéStops to get more.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_2_2
TEXT: Spinning the Photo Disc at a PokéStop can grant you those items as well as other goodies. You can also get Field Research tasks by doing so, which you can complete to encounter Pokémon or receive items.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_2_3
TEXT: PokéStops are usually located at interesting places, like a monument, a public park, or a local café.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_2_4
TEXT: They encourage Trainers to explore the world around them. Isn’t that exciting?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_2_5
TEXT: Why don’t you go do some exploring? Who knows—you might discover some interesting places!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_3_0
TEXT: Welcome back, Trainer! I just returned from a stroll myself. One thing I love about Field Research is how it always manages to take me to new and exciting locations.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_3_1
TEXT: I hope you get to learn a bit more about the world around you as you seek out different PokéStops!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_3_2
TEXT: And as fun as that will be, it’ll be even more fun if you bring along a Buddy Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_3_3
TEXT: Building strong relationships with your Pokémon is pivotal to being a good Trainer—and choosing a Pokémon to be your buddy is a great way to do just that!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_3_4
TEXT: You can choose any Pokémon to be your Buddy Pokémon. It can even walk alongside you while you’re out exploring!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_3_5
TEXT: To get your buddy to join you on your adventures, give it some treats, such as Berries.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_3_6
TEXT: You can boost your friendship with your Buddy Pokémon even further by playing with it, taking photos of it, and battling with it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_3_7
TEXT: Eventually, your Buddy Pokémon can even become your Best Buddy and gain a Best Buddy ribbon! You’ll also earn additional Candy when you walk around with it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_3_8
TEXT: We’ll cover the importance of Candy later, but for now, how about you pick out a Buddy Pokémon and spend some time with it?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_4_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! Wow, your Buddy Pokémon’s looking pretty pleased! Seeing your bond grow stronger warms my heart.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_4_1
TEXT: Keep taking care of your Pokémon to make your relationship flourish!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_4_2
TEXT: I see you’ve earned some Candy while exploring with your buddy, too. It’s now time to learn how you can get more Candy, as well as what you can use it for.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_4_3
TEXT: You can earn Candy by catching, transferring, and adventuring with Pokémon. You can then use that Candy to power up and evolve your Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_4_4
TEXT: You’ll also need Stardust, which you can earn by catching Pokémon, hatching Eggs, completing research, and opening Gifts.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_4_5
TEXT: Evolving Pokémon helps you fill out your Pokédex and learn all about your Pokémon’s potential. There are even some Pokémon that evolve in unique ways.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_4_6
TEXT: Be sure to check the Pokémon in your Pokémon storage to learn more about how to evolve them. You’ll also be able to power up your Pokémon there.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_4_7
TEXT: If you need help figuring out which Pokémon to power up and evolve, you can ask your team leader to appraise your Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_4_8
TEXT: You should have some Candy and Stardust from completing previous research tasks. How about you use them to evolve and power up some Pokémon?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_5_0
TEXT: Incredible work, %PLAYERNAME%! Your Pokémon look stronger than ever. Did you learn anything new while evolving and powering up your Pokémon?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_5_1
TEXT: When I see a Pokémon discover new possibilities within itself, it makes me feel like I’m capable of anything, too!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_5_2
TEXT: But as exciting as that all is, there’s just as much to learn about Pokémon in some of their earliest forms, too.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_5_3
TEXT: Next, we’re going to discuss Eggs and Pokémon that can hatch from them.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_5_4
TEXT: You can get 2 km, 5 km, and 10 km Eggs by spinning PokéStops, and you can get 7 km Eggs by opening Gifts from your friends.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_5_5
TEXT: To hatch these Eggs, you’ll need to place them in an Incubator and travel the indicated distance.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_5_6
TEXT: If you want to hatch Eggs even faster, Super Incubators decrease the distance required to hatch Eggs. Be sure to use these Incubators wisely.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_5_7
TEXT: You’ll be able to get Eggs in other ways, too.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_5_8
TEXT: For example, you can get Strange Eggs by defeating Team GO Rocket Leaders. As you go on your Trainer journey, you’ll have opportunities to take on Team GO Rocket and obtain these Eggs.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_5_9
TEXT: You should have a handful of Eggs already. How about you get to hatching some?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_6_0
TEXT: Look at all the Eggs you’ve hatched, %PLAYERNAME%! What an accomplishment.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_6_1
TEXT: Being a dedicated Trainer takes quite a bit of work, wouldn’t you say? Even so, you can’t forget to have fun along the way.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_6_2
TEXT: You’ll see in your Item Bag that you have a camera. You can use this camera to take snapshots of your Pokémon and commemorate all sorts of moments and memories.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_6_3
TEXT: You can take a snapshot when encountering wild Pokémon, when viewing your Pokémon in your Pokémon storage, and when interacting with your buddy.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_6_4
TEXT: How about you give it a shot? A...snapshot, that is. Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_7_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, I’ve been looking through the photos you took, and I have to say, I’m quite impressed!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_7_1
TEXT: Have you considered moonlighting as a Pokémon photographer? You certainly have the chops for it!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_7_10
TEXT: An important part of battling effectively is using attacks that are super effective against the Pokémon defending the Gym.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_7_11
TEXT: Different Pokémon and their attacks have different types, and those types have weaknesses to other types. For example, Fire-type Pokémon are weak against Water-type attacks.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_7_12
TEXT: I’d like for you to try using supereffective attacks when battling at a Gym. Try using Charged Attacks of different types to see which ones work best.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_7_13
TEXT: Let’s see what you’re made of, %PLAYERNAME%! Get out there and battle in some Gyms.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_7_2
TEXT: Do you recognize these structures? I’m sure you’ve come across them in your photographic forays.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_7_3
TEXT: They’re called Gyms, and they’ll prove to be quite important in your Trainer journey.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_7_4
TEXT: Gyms are always one of four colors, depending on which team controls them.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_7_5
TEXT: Red Gyms are controlled by Team Valor, led by the headstrong Candela. Blue Gyms are controlled by Team Mystic, headed up by the analytical Blanche.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_7_6
TEXT: Yellow Gyms are controlled by Team Instinct, whose proud leader is the incomparable Spark. He’s known for following his gut.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_7_7
TEXT: Gray Gyms are neutral, meaning that no team controls them.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_7_8
TEXT: If a Gym is controlled by your team, you can assign a Pokémon to defend it. Gyms can have up to six Pokémon defending them at a time.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_7_9
TEXT: If a Gym is controlled by another team, you can battle to try to claim it. Find a Gym that’s controlled by a different team, and give battling a shot!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_8_0
TEXT: How was your Gym experience, %PLAYERNAME%? A unique kind of workout, isn’t it? Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_8_1
TEXT: Anyhoo, did you notice that at some Gyms, you were faced with a single Pokémon instead of Gym defenders?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_8_2
TEXT: Those Pokémon are called Raid Bosses, and you can challenge them in Raid Battles!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_8_3
TEXT: In Raid Battles, you can battle alongside friends and other Trainers to challenge a Raid Boss.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_8_4
TEXT: These Pokémon are formidable foes, indeed. Sometimes, you can find certain Pokémon only as Raid Bosses.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_8_5
TEXT: Before entering a Raid Battle, make sure to power up your Pokémon! Stocking up on lots of Candy and Stardust will allow you to bring powerful teams to Raid Battles.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_8_6
TEXT: Power up some Pokémon, then try taking on a raid. If you don’t succeed, you can team up with other Trainers.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_8_7
TEXT: You’ll never know what you’re capable of until you try, right? 

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_12_0
TEXT: Well hello, %PLAYERNAME%! Welcome back. It’s around this time of year that nights in the Northern Hemisphere begin growing longer and longer. The sun shines brighter while it’s up, though, so it’s a pretty fair trade!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_12_1
TEXT: If you ask me, this is a prime opportunity to ponder the power of light and darkness—both literally and metaphorically. I wonder what darkness our little friend Hoopa has had to overcome? I have a feeling its mischievous reputation may hang over it like a shadow at times.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_12_2
TEXT: What’s more, I can’t help but wonder how and why its power was confined.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_12_3
TEXT: Pokémon are an endless source of mystery. We may never know all their secrets, but it’s a researcher’s job to shine a light into the darkest depths of the unknown and illuminate whatever answers we can!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_12_4
TEXT: For me, darkness is an opportunity to learn something new. To make discoveries! We’ve learned so much about Hoopa in our research, and in some ways, I think we may have learned a bit about ourselves, too.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_12_5
TEXT: But enough of my rambling! How about you head on out there and enjoy the light, %PLAYERNAME%? You’ve earned it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_13_0
TEXT: I’m glad to see you again, Trainer! I was out on a walk and got to thinking about your journey with Hoopa thus far.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_13_1
TEXT: It seems that Hoopa’s really taken a shine to you. Do you think it may show us more of its power soon? A professor can dream, I suppose.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_13_2
TEXT: Why don’t you check back again in a bit, %PLAYERNAME%, after you’ve spent a tad more time with Hoopa.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_14_0
TEXT: I’m glad to see you, %PLAYERNAME%. I wish I had better news, but it looks like Team GO Rocket is stirring up trouble once again!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_14_1
TEXT: While out on patrol, Spark and Candela overheard some Team GO Rocket Grunts discussing the organization’s next move. They want to capture Hoopa! It seems their orders came straight from Giovanni himself.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_14_2
TEXT: I shudder to think that all this time Giovanni may have been lurking in the shadows just behind us, reaping the benefits of our research. Scheming as we studied Hoopa...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_14_3
TEXT: There’s no time to lose—we have to stop them! Hoopa Unbound is incredibly powerful, and I have no doubt that Giovanni intends to use it for some sinister purpose.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_14_4
TEXT: You know better than most, %PLAYERNAME%: Hoopa may be capable of terrifying things, but it’s still a Pokémon. It must be protected!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_14_5
TEXT: We’ve also gotten word that Giovanni has turned another Legendary Pokémon into a Shadow Pokémon! The team leaders and I will do what we can, but we’ll need your help if we’re to defeat Giovanni, save the Legendary Shadow Pokémon, and keep Hoopa safe.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_15_0
TEXT: Incredible work, %PLAYERNAME%! You’ve successfully defeated Team GO Rocket yet again and saved another Legendary Shadow Pokémon—and Hoopa, too!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_15_1
TEXT: Speaking of Hoopa, I have a sneaking suspicion that because of your kindness, we might just be lucky enough to witness it as Hoopa Unbound someday soon. What a sight that will be, eh?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_15_2
TEXT: We’ve come a long way in our research, and unlocking Hoopa’s true power may be the final trial in this mysterious saga. Are you ready, Trainer? Let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shint_0_1
TEXT: The strangest thing happened last night: I noticed a veritable bevy of bobbing, blinking lights bouncing around at the far end of a nearby park—but by the time I’d run over, the area was empty and dark.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shint_0_2
TEXT: I have a feeling those flickering lights may somehow be connected to an Electric-type Pokémon, but I can’t be sure!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shint_0_3
TEXT: How about we do a little investigating, hm? Maybe those Pokémon are still nearby.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shint_1_0
TEXT: Well, would you look at that! It’s Shinx, the Flash Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shint_1_1
TEXT: Considering all I’ve heard about this cute little creature, I have a theory.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shint_1_2
TEXT: Shinx sends signals to others of its kind by shaking the tip of its lit-up tail.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shint_1_3
TEXT: Last night’s anomaly was likely a group of Shinx having a chat!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shint_1_4
TEXT: Now that you’ve caught a Shinx, why don’t we do some research into its Evolution, Luxio?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shint_1_5
TEXT: Strong electricity courses through the tips of Luxio’s sharp claws. What a shocking combination! Let’s learn more about it, shall we?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shint_2_0
TEXT: Well done, %PLAYERNAME%—you’ve got yourself a Luxio!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shint_2_1
TEXT: Also known as the Spark Pokémon, Luxio can receive a bit of other Luxio’s electricity by joining their tails together.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shint_2_2
TEXT: So, Shinx can use their tails to communicate with one another, and Luxio can gather their tails together to collectively generate powerful electricity. Fascinating!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shint_2_3
TEXT: I wonder what else there is to learn about this Pokémon’s Evolutionary line. How about you evolve your Luxio and we find out for ourselves!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shint_3_0
TEXT: Ah, Luxray, the Gleam Eyes Pokémon! When its eyes gleam gold, it can spot hidden prey—even through thick walls.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shint_3_1
TEXT: But seeing through solid objects uses a lot of its electricity, so Luxray sleep for long periods of time to store up energy.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shint_3_2
TEXT: What an electrifying revelation! We’ve learned a lot about Shinx and its Evolutions, but I bet there’s still much to discover.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shint_3_3
TEXT: Despite all that hard work, it seems you’ve still got a little spark left in you—so why don’t you head back out and see what other adventures await? Let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! It’s great to see you again.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_0_1
TEXT: I wanted to tell you about what I saw on my morning walk today—a herd of Spheal rolling across an icy lake!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_0_2
TEXT: Did you know that a Spheal always travels by rolling around on its ball-like body?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_0_3
TEXT: When the season for ice floes arrives, Spheal can be seen rolling about on ice and crossing the sea.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_0_4
TEXT: They’re also covered in fluffy fur to keep them from feeling cold in icy climes. And I’ll tell you, seeing them tumble to-and-fro warmed me right up, too!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_0_5
TEXT: Why don’t you go check out some Spheal for yourself?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! I see you’ve brought some Spheal with you. Aren’t they just the roundest?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_1_1
TEXT: According to my research, the Evolution of Spheal, Sealeo, seems to agree! Sealeo can occasionally be seen entertaining itself by balancing a Spheal on its nose as if juggling a ball.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_1_2
TEXT: In fact, when Sealeo sees just about anything for the first time, it tends to try juggling it on its nose! Why don’t you evolve your Spheal and see for yourself?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_2_0
TEXT: Welcome back, Trainer—and hello there, Sealeo!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_2_1
TEXT: I have some breaking news for you. Remember that icy lake I told you about earlier?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_2_2
TEXT: Well, it looks like something’s broken it up, and now all the Spheal are splashing around in the water! They seem to be having fun, but I wonder what Pokémon could have caused this.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_2_3
TEXT: My best guess is Walrein. Walrein is known to swim through frigid water while crushing icebergs with its grand, imposing tusks. Sounds pretty magnificent, if a bit imposing.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_2_4
TEXT: Can you evolve your Sealeo so we can research Walrein ourselves?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_3_0
TEXT: You did it, Trainer! Walrein’s tusks really are magnificent up close, aren’t they?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_3_1
TEXT: Did you know that Walrein typically gather in herds of about 20 or 30? When a threat appears, the herd’s leader will do whatever it takes to protect the group.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_3_2
TEXT: Nice to know they can look after themselves—though considering those tusks, I don’t think that was ever in doubt. Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_3_3
TEXT: I’m sure your Walrein will protect you in battle as well. You already look like quite a powerful pair!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_3_4
TEXT: Thanks for going on this adventure with me today, %PLAYERNAME%! I’ve learned a lot from the research you conducted. Until next time, let’s GO!
