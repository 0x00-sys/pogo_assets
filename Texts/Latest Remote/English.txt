RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_duskt_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! Have you noticed an increase in Ghost-type Pokémon appearing lately? Because I sure have.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_duskt_0_1
TEXT: I was conducting some research in my lab recently when I felt a chill run up my spine—almost like something was watching me from the shadows.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_duskt_0_2
TEXT: I whirled around to face my uninvited guest and saw a Pokémon floating eerily in the corner! Apparently startled by my gaze, it flew through the wall and escaped into the great outdoors. I haven’t seen it since.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_duskt_0_3
TEXT: Based on my brief glimpse of it and its quick escape, I believe my visitor was Duskull, the Requiem Pokémon. It’s known to silently sneak up on its prey by making itself invisible. It also has the ability to slip straight through thick walls.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_duskt_0_4
TEXT: Naturally, my goal now is to learn more about Duskull. Can you lend me a hand? Hopefully we can come to understand why it was sneaking around my lab!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_duskt_1_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! Great work researching Duskull. While you were out, I actually had another eerie encounter in my lab.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_duskt_1_1
TEXT: I saw Duskull slipping through a wall to scare me again, so I shouted, “BOO!” before it could and turned the tables. It fled back through the wall—but then it reappeared and looked at me expectantly.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_duskt_1_2
TEXT: Thus began an impromptu game of peek-a-boo! It made me realize that Duskull may not get many chances to play with others because people are so quick to startle at its appearance. Makes you a bit sad, doesn’t it?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_duskt_1_3
TEXT: I wonder what else we can learn about Duskull. I know: Why don’t you try evolving your Duskull into Dusclops? Also known as the Beckon Pokémon, Dusclops apparently sucks everything in as if it were a black hole—so be careful of its mouth!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_duskt_2_0
TEXT: Wait, %PLAYERNAME%, you did WHAT? I was so sure I told you NOT to feed a Berry to Dusclops... But maybe I said the opposite by mistake? Yeah, my bad on that one.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_duskt_2_1
TEXT: But it just ate the Berry normally, huh? No danger of you getting sucked in as well? Fascinating... O-oh, and, er, quite relieving! Yes, glad to see you back in one piece.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_duskt_2_2
TEXT: Now, let’s learn more about Dusclops’s Evolution, Dusknoir. Known as the Gripper Pokémon, it’s said to steal people and Pokémon away at the behest of transmissions from the spirit world.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_duskt_2_3
TEXT: No one knows whether Dusknoir has a will of its own. Sounds like a Pokémon ripe for researching! Could you evolve your Dusclops for me so we can learn more?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_duskt_3_0
TEXT: Hey there, Trai— AAAH! G-G-G-GHOST! Behind you! It’s— Wait. Is that Dusknoir? Hah, sorry about that. It’s my first time seeing one!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_duskt_3_1
TEXT: No matter how spooky they may seem, we have to remember that Ghost-type Pokémon are Pokémon all the same. They’re looking for friends just like the rest of us!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_duskt_3_2
TEXT: Thanks for your help today, %PLAYERNAME%. I hope to see you and your Dusknoir again soon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_0_0
TEXT: OoOoOo... There’s a chill in the air... Can you feel it, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_0_1
TEXT: Seems like I’ve been getting goosebumps every few minutes lately! Is it just drafty, or are all the Ghost-type Pokémon we’ve been seeing somehow involved?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_0_2
TEXT: Either way, I think we’re in for another adventure! Whatever happens, we’ll face it together.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_0_3
TEXT: Speaking of faces, I’ve noticed a lot of Yamask in the area lately.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_0_4
TEXT: I’ve been hoping to do some research on it and other Ghost-type Pokémon, so it seems like now’s the time.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_0_5
TEXT: Mind lending me a hand, Trainer?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_1_0
TEXT: Ah—a Yamask AND a Duskull!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_1_1
TEXT: I recently had an encounter with a Duskull that seemed creepy at first but ended up being quite heartwarming.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_1_2
TEXT: It was a lovely reminder not to judge a Pokémon by its...well, skull, I suppose!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_1_3
TEXT: Now, about that Yamask.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_1_4
TEXT: Known as the Spirit Pokémon, Yamask is said to wander through ruins by night carrying a mask that was once its human face.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_1_5
TEXT: A rather melancholy existence, if true, wouldn’t you say?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_1_6
TEXT: What must it feel like to carry around a mask of your former self? No offense to Yamask, but I hope I never have to find out firsthand.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_1_7
TEXT: Did you know that Yamask found in Galar are different than those found in Unova?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_1_8
TEXT: Perhaps you’ll come across one while you’re out conducting research.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_1_9
TEXT: I wonder just how these Yamask differ. Let’s go find out!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_2_0
TEXT: Wow, a Galarian Yamask!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_2_1
TEXT: Unlike Yamask first found in Unova, Galarian Yamask carries a slab rather than a mask.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_2_2
TEXT: It’s said that the slab bears cursed engravings and possesses Yamask itself. Talk about spooky!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_2_3
TEXT: Oh, and you’ve encountered a Banette, too! Did you know that Banette is said to be a doll that became a Pokémon through the power of its grudge toward the child that disowned it?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_2_4
TEXT: I wouldn’t want to be that kid, that’s for sure!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_2_5
TEXT: Between Galarian Yamask’s slab, Banette’s puppet body, and all the Pokémon in costumes walking around, it feels like the spooky factor’s turned way up at the moment!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_2_6
TEXT: Even so, I’d still like to learn more about Ghost-type Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_2_7
TEXT: Come on, Trainer—let’s get back out there!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_3_0
TEXT: Looks like we’re coming up on the last stretch of our research here, Trainer. And hey, it looks like you found yourself an Alolan Marowak!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_3_1
TEXT: Did you know that the bones used by some Marowak belonged to their mothers?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_3_2
TEXT: In fact, Cubone—which evolves into Marowak—is even said to wear the skull of its mother.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_3_3
TEXT: When Cubone evolves into Alolan Marowak, its mother’s regrets protect it like a vengeful spirit.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_3_4
TEXT: Hmm. Between Alolan Marowak, Banette, and Yamask, we’ve witnessed the power of quite a few spirits, haven’t we?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_3_5
TEXT: Try as I might to explain why Ghost-type Pokémon seem spooky, sometimes I just come up blank. But that won’t stop me from continuing to try!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_3_6
TEXT: After all, I always feel like I learn a bit more about myself when I’m studying Pokémon. You know what I mean?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_3_7
TEXT: Anyway, I think we’re more than due some rest and treats after all that research. See you next time, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_0_0
TEXT: Ah, %PLAYERNAME%—perfect timing!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_0_1
TEXT: Come look at this. See that there, in the dirt?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_0_2
TEXT: That’s right—footprints! Though not human ones, I’d wager.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_0_3
TEXT: You’d be hard pressed to find shoes that would fit whatever feet made these, I think! There must be a Pokémon responsible, though I’m not sure which one...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_0_4
TEXT: I’m going to stick around and see if I can’t learn a bit more from these footprints, so why don’t you follow them and see where they take you?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_0_5
TEXT: Make sure to snap some photos of your findings!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_1_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! That Ground-type Pokémon you caught looks spectacular.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_1_1
TEXT: Did you know that Drilbur, the Mole Pokémon, can dig through the ground at incredible speeds?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_1_2
TEXT: In the Galar region, Drilbur often leave farmers in a tizzy because they damage their crops. Sounds like mole than they can handle, eh? Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_1_3
TEXT: Anyway, while you were out, I received reports that the Pokémon we’re looking for has vines on its body.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_1_4
TEXT: How about you search the bushes nearby to see if you can find any vines? Don’t forget to snap some photos, too!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_2_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%. You got a great shot of that Bug-type Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_2_1
TEXT: I encountered a curious Bug-type Pokémon myself, actually: Combee.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_2_2
TEXT: Known as the Tiny Bee Pokémon, Combee is actually a trio! The three work together to collect honey and deliver it to their colony.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_2_3
TEXT: Such abundant teamwork sure is admirable!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_2_4
TEXT: I’m sure our team leaders strive to achieve that same level of synergy.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_2_5
TEXT: Anyway, the Combee I saw got me thinking: Maybe we’ve been searching too close to the ground. If my hypothesis is correct, we’re on the trail of a Pokémon that can sometimes be seen hopping from tree to tree.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_2_6
TEXT: This time, try searching among the trees to see if you can find any leads. And don’t forget to photograph your findings!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_3_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! Sweet Nuzleaf.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_3_1
TEXT: I believe the Pokémon we’re after tends to live deep in forests—much like Nuzleaf does—so we should be on the right track.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_3_2
TEXT: Ah, look—your Nuzleaf just started playing its grass flute!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_3_3
TEXT: The sound of it is said to make its listeners uneasy. I wonder if it’s trying to lead the Pokémon out into the open...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_3_4
TEXT: Wait, what was that?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_3_5
TEXT: Look there! A dark shadow just dashed across the sky! Keep your eyes up, %PLAYERNAME%, and chase after it! Let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_4_0
TEXT: Great job out there, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_4_1
TEXT: The photo you sent me speaks to your efforts. And I see you made a new friend in that Rufflet!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_4_2
TEXT: Did you know that Rufflet will challenge Pokémon stronger than itself, even if it might lose? That’s how it pushes itself to grow!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_4_3
TEXT: Pretty brave, huh? I think bravery is exactly what we’ll need as we prepare to encounter the mysterious Pokémon we’ve been tracking.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_4_4
TEXT: Thanks to all the information we’ve gathered, I’m certain that we’re dealing with Zarude, the Rogue Monkey Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_4_5
TEXT: The Mythical Pokémon Zarude tend to live in packs in the forest, but it looks like the one we’ve been following is all on its own.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_4_6
TEXT: Sounds like the perfect chance to catch it, don’t you think?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_4_7
TEXT: With everything we’ve learned—and all the Pokémon friends you’ve made along the way—I’m sure you’ll succeed!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_0_0
TEXT: Hey, %PLAYERNAME%! Have you run into any Pokémon wearing fun costumes recently? I’ve seen quite a few around my mobile lab.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_0_1
TEXT: It reminded me how freeing it can be to express yourself in different ways. Personally, I’m a big fan of turning up my tunes and shredding on the air guitar!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_0_2
TEXT: Others, like Spark, are really into taking snapshots of Pokémon and the world around them. I wonder how those Pokémon feel when they wear those costumes.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_0_3
TEXT: Sounds to me like some research is in order!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, Trainer! I was digging through some old files while you were out when I began to hear a strange melody coming from somewhere nearby.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_1_1
TEXT: I ran out to investigate, and in my haste, I ended up bumping straight into Blanche, who’d been sorting through some Berries.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_1_2
TEXT: Blanche was none too pleased to see those Berries scattered on the ground, but the costumed Pokémon that rushed in to gobble them up sure seemed thankful. Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_1_3
TEXT: Seeing them relish those Berries gave me an idea. Cooking food can be a terrific way to express yourself, and giving food to those we care about is one of the most heartfelt things we do for one another.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_1_4
TEXT: I wonder how different Pokémon react to different foods. While I go on a Berry run, why don’t you do some research on how Pokémon feel after eating?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_2_0
TEXT: Thanks for completing those research tasks, Trainer! Reading the results of your research made my heart full—and my stomach rumbly! Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_2_1
TEXT: Ah, by the way! I heard that mysterious melody again while I was collecting Berries. I think it may be the product of a certain Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_2_2
TEXT: I wasn’t able to look into it further at the time—my hands were quite full with Berries—but I’m hoping we can investigate it together soon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_2_3
TEXT: For now, could you continue researching how people and Pokémon express themselves?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_2_4
TEXT: For many Trainers and their Pokémon, battling is a primary outlet of self-expression. In fact, Candela believes that the feelings she shares with her Pokémon can directly influence the outcome of a battle.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_2_5
TEXT: Why don’t you go out and see for yourself? I’ll be cheering you on from here!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_3_0
TEXT: Welcome back, Trainer. Did you learn anything about expressing yourself in battle?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_3_1
TEXT: While you were out, I managed to track that mysterious melody to a location nearby. I think the source may be none other than Meloetta, the Melody Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_3_2
TEXT: Did you know that its melodies are sung with a special vocalization method that can control the feelings of those who hear it?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_3_3
TEXT: Maybe if we find a way to express ourselves through song as well, you’ll be able to catch Meloetta’s attention! What do you say, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_4_0
TEXT: Well done, %PLAYERNAME%! I knew you’d find a way to catch Meloetta’s attention.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_4_1
TEXT: They say many famous songs have been inspired by the melodies that Meloetta produces, and it’s not hard to see why. Self-expression through song is a truly powerful thing!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_4_2
TEXT: I think this would be a fine opportunity for you to partner with Meloetta and share who you are with your friends. I’m sure Meloetta would be happy to learn more about you, too!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_5_0
TEXT: Da da da dooo... Da dee doo, dee da dee dum...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_5_1
TEXT: Oh, %PLAYERNAME%—I didn’t see you there! I was just rocking out to one of my favorite songs. After so much research on how people express themselves, I felt compelled to indulge in a bit of self-expression myself!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_5_2
TEXT: Whether it’s serving looks or serving lunch, a Pokémon battle or battle of the bands, there’s no limit to the ways you can express who you are. What’s your method of choice, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_5_3
TEXT: Maybe you’re still figuring it out—and that’s totally fine. Everyone’s journey is unique! Whatever the case, you have my support—and Meloetta’s, too. Now, let’s get out there and show the world who we are!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_0_0
TEXT: Hi there! It’s so nice to meet you %PLAYERNAME%. My name is Professor Willow, I’m a researcher of Pokémon and will be guiding you on your Trainer journey—and what a journey it’ll be!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_0_1
TEXT: You’ll also be helping me a ton with my research along the way.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_0_2
TEXT: First things first, you’ll need to learn how to do three things: catch Pokémon, throw a Curveball, and transfer Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_0_3
TEXT: You can catch Pokémon with a Poké Ball.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_0_4
TEXT: Depending on how expertly you aim your Poké Ball at the center of the Pokémon and the timing of your throw, you can achieve Nice, Great, or Excellent throws.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_0_5
TEXT: Curveballs are more advanced throws you can make that can help you grow as a Trainer too. Simply spin the ball as you throw it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_0_6
TEXT: It’s OK if you don’t get it at first—practice makes perfect after all!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_0_7
TEXT: Once you’ve caught some Pokémon, you can keep them in your Pokémon Inventory or transfer them to my mobile lab in return for that Pokémon’s Candy.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_0_8
TEXT: Don’t worry about Candy for now, I’ll explain more about that later on. Now let’s GO and catch some Pokémon,  shall we?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_1_0
TEXT: Hello again, %PLAYERNAME%! How was catching and transferring Pokémon? Not too bad after the first few tries, right?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_1_1
TEXT: Soon you’ll be throwing Excellent Curveballs as naturally as a Water-type Pokémon swims in water!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_1_2
TEXT: I’d like to talk to you about an item that I’ve created with my research called Incense.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_1_3
TEXT: It emits a fragrance that is irresistible to Pokémon, making them come to you, instead of having you go to them! Handy, eh?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_1_4
TEXT: This tool is surely an important one that any Trainer should have in their Items.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_1_5
TEXT: Speaking of items, have you heard of Berries? There are several Berries that Pokémon enjoy eating, and they each have different effects. For example: the Nanab Berry.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_1_6
TEXT: Nanab Berries calm active Pokémon down to make aiming your Poké Ball an easier task.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_1_7
TEXT: Let’s give one a try, shall we? Go ahead and use an Incense and then a Nanab Berry to help you catch a new Pokémon friend!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_2_0
TEXT: Hello, %PLAYERNAME%! Great work catching those Pokémon with the help of those Berries.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_2_1
TEXT: If you’re ever running low on Berries or Poké Balls, you can always stop by your nearest PokéStop to get more!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_2_2
TEXT: Spinning the Photo Disc will grant you those items and sometimes other extra goodies too, as well as grant you Field Research tasks to do to encounter more Pokémon or receive more items.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_2_3
TEXT: PokéStops are usually located at interesting places, like a building, a public park, or a local café.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_2_4
TEXT: They appear to encourage Trainers to explore new places they might never have considered exploring before. Isn’t that exciting?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_2_5
TEXT: Let’s get to exploring then!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_3_0
TEXT: Aren’t discovering new places fun? What I love best about being a professor that specializes in field research is that my curiosity always takes me to new and exciting locations.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_3_1
TEXT: I hope you got to learn a bit more about the world around you while exploring those PokéStops!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_3_2
TEXT: You know what always makes adventures more fun? Why, that’s a buddy of course!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_3_3
TEXT: Any Pokémon can become a Buddy Pokémon with enough love and care—they’ll even walk alongside you while you’re out exploring!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_3_4
TEXT: An important part of being a good Trainer is cultivating your relationship with your Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_3_5
TEXT: You can do this by playing with them, giving them treats, taking photos of them, and battling with them.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_3_6
TEXT: When you do, your friendship with them will improve and they’ll join you on your adventure.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_3_7
TEXT: Eventually, they can even become your Best Buddy and gain a Best Buddy ribbon! When walking around with you, you can also earn additional Candy with them.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_3_8
TEXT: We’ll cover the importance of Candy when you come back, but for now, how about you pick your favorite Pokémon and spend some time with them?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_4_0
TEXT: Hey there %PLAYERNAME%! Wow, your buddy’s lookin’ pretty happy! Call me a softie, but seeing Pokémon happy always makes me feel happy too.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_4_1
TEXT: When we take care of our Pokémon, they care of us back and I think that’s just neat.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_4_2
TEXT: I see you’ve earned some Candy while exploring with your buddy! It’s now time to learn about what we use Candy for: powering up and Evolving Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_4_3
TEXT: The Candy you earn from catching, transferring, and adventuring with Pokémon can be used in this way.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_4_4
TEXT: Another resource that you need is Stardust, which can be earned by catching and hatching Pokémon, and from other places too like completing research and opening Gifts.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_4_5
TEXT: Evolving Pokémon helps you complete your Pokédex and learn all about your Pokémon’s potential! There are even some Pokémon that evolve in unique ways.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_4_6
TEXT: Be sure to check your Pokémon’s page to learn more about how to Evolve them. If you’re interested in making your Pokémon stronger, then Powering Up is the way to go.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_4_7
TEXT: You can also ask your Team Leader to appraise your Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_4_8
TEXT: You should have a pretty hefty supply of Candy and Stardust built up from completing the previous research tasks. Let’s get to evolving and powering up some Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_5_0
TEXT: Incredible work, %PLAYERNAME%! Your Pokémon look stronger than ever. Did you learn anything new when evolving or powering up your Pokémon?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_5_1
TEXT: When I see a Pokémon discover new possibilities within itself, it makes me feel like I’m capable of anything too!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_5_2
TEXT: However, there’s just as much to learn about Pokémon in some of their earliest forms too—specifically ones from Eggs!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_5_3
TEXT: You guessed it, the next thing we’re going to learn about are Eggs and Pokémon that can hatch from them.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_5_4
TEXT: There are 2 km, 5 km, and 10 km that you can receive by spinning PokéStops, 7 km Eggs that you can receive by opening Gifts.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_5_5
TEXT: To hatch these Eggs, you’ll need to place them in an Incubator and travel the distance indicated!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_5_6
TEXT: Some Incubators help Eggs hatch faster by decreasing the distance needed to explore, so be wise and intentional with which ones to use when.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_5_7
TEXT: There are other Eggs as well, such as Strange Eggs that you can receive by defeating Team GO Rocket Leaders.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_5_8
TEXT: You shouldn’t worry about encountering them soon, but when you do, you’ll have a chance to receive one of these 12 km Eggs from those battles.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_5_9
TEXT: You should have a handful of Eggs in your bag already. Let’s get to hatching some, shall we?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_6_0
TEXT: Look at all the adorable Pokémon you’ve hatched, %PLAYERNAME%! What an accomplishment, I know you must’ve traveled quite a bit to hatch these little ones.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_6_1
TEXT: Being a dedicated Trainer takes quite a bit of work, don’t you say? However—we can’t forget to have a little bit of fun too!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_6_2
TEXT: You’ll see in your Bag that you have a Camera. You can use this Camera to take snapshots of your Pokémon to commemorate all sorts of moments and memories.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_6_3
TEXT: Snapshots can be taken from three places: when encountering wild Pokémon, from viewing your Pokémon in your Box, and when interacting with your buddy.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_6_4
TEXT: Let’s give it a shot! A...snapshot, that is, ha ha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_7_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, I am looking through the photos you took and I have to say I’m quite impressed!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_7_1
TEXT: Have you considered moonlighting as a Pokémon photographer? You have the chops for it, that’s for sure!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_7_10
TEXT: I’d like you to also learn how to battle effectively, so try to use a Pokémon that has a Charged Attack that’s Super Effective against the types of Pokémon currently defending that Gym.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_7_11
TEXT: Different Pokémon and their moves have different types, and those types have weaknesses to other types.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_7_12
TEXT: For example, Fire-type Pokémon are weak against Water-type moves. Be strategic in battle, %PLAYERNAME%! I know you can do it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_7_13
TEXT: Let’s see what you’re made of, %PLAYERNAME%! Get out there and battle in some Gyms.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_7_2
TEXT: While you’ve been adventuring and taking photos, I’m sure you’ve come across these structures.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_7_3
TEXT: They’re bigger than PokéStops and come in four colors, depending on which team (or a lack thereof) is currently controlling it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_7_4
TEXT: They’re called Gyms and being a Trainer also includes knowing how to battle in them!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_7_5
TEXT: Red Gyms are controlled by Team Valor, led by the headstrong Candela, blue Gyms are controlled by Team Mystic, headed up by the analytical Blanche,

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_7_6
TEXT: and yellow Gyms are controlled by Team Instinct, whose proud leader is the incomparable Spark. He’s known for following his gut.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_7_7
TEXT: Gray Gyms are neutral and currently have no team that controls them.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_7_8
TEXT: In Gyms controlled by your team, if there are less than six Pokémon in there already, you can leave Pokémon to defend the Gym on your behalf.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_7_9
TEXT: In Gyms controlled by other teams, you can battle to try to claim it. Find a Gym that’s controlled by a different team and give battling a shot!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_8_0
TEXT: "How was that workout, %PLAYERNAME%? Get it, because you were just battling at a Gym? Ha ha! Just kidding, I know it’s Pokémon battling at them and not you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_8_1
TEXT: Anywho, did you notice that some Gyms you couldn’t battle against its Gym defenders and instead were faced with a single Pokémon?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_8_2
TEXT: Those are called raid bosses and those battles are called Raid Battles!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_8_3
TEXT: Most battles involve one Pokémon fighting another, but in Raid Battles, you can battle alongside friends and other Trainers to take down one Pokémon together.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_8_4
TEXT: These Pokémon are sometimes rare and powerful and can only be found in raids.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_8_5
TEXT: Before entering one, make sure your Pokémon are as powerful as can be! This is where your Candy and Stardust can come into good use—by powering up your most powerful Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_8_6
TEXT: Give that a shot first and then take your chance at a raid. If you don't succeed, find local other local Trainers to team up with.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_8_7
TEXT: You’ll never know what you’re capable of until you try right?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_oshat_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! Did you know that Oshawott uses the scalchop on its stomach not only to fight but also to break open hard berries? Gotta love a good multitool.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_oshat_3_1
TEXT: Thanks for all your help today, %PLAYERNAME%. We’ve learned so much about Oshawott, Dewott, and Samurott—and from them, too! I’ll “sea” you next time! Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_0_3
TEXT: How do I know? Well, I was doing some lab work recently when my glasses were lifted straight off my head. Spark was there assisting me, and he said he saw a small, lavender-colored hand emerge from a ring and snatch my glasses. Pretty cheeky, eh?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_10_0
TEXT: ... ... ...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_10_1
TEXT: BOO! Haha, did I scare you? Not too badly, I hope.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_10_2
TEXT: Let’s continue our investigation into these eerie events. Don’t worry—I won’t send you into any rickety mansions or foggy forests.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_10_3
TEXT: I was actually doing some research near a forest myself recently, and I found a rather odd-looking tree. I’ve learned over the years to trust my gut when something seems strange in the field—chances are it’s a Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_10_4
TEXT: I couldn’t help but indulge my curiosity, and I stepped toward the tree to observe it more closely. As soon as I did, the tree pivoted on its roots and stared me down with a single red eye!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_10_5
TEXT: It didn’t take long for me to realize I was standing before a Trevenant, the Elder Tree Pokémon. Trevenant will trap people who harm their forest, never allowing them to leave. 

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_10_6
TEXT: It must have sensed that I was just there for research because it turned back around and ignored me. Its attention then turned to the many Phantump gathered around it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_10_7
TEXT: That’s when I realized that Trevenant was harvesting Berries from the nearby trees to feed the Phantump! Trevenant is known to offer great kindness to forest-dwelling Pokémon, and it was lovely to witness it myself.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_10_8
TEXT: Ghost-type Pokémon can seem frightening at first glance, but look a little closer and you’ll find they’re full of surprises. I’m sure the same goes for Hoopa! 

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_10_9
TEXT: I have a feeling there’s more to Hoopa than its penchant for mischief. Maybe we’ll find some answers after we conduct some more research on Ghost-type Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_11_0
TEXT: Great work, %PLAYERNAME%! As we close out our spooky investigations, I have a feeling there are some bright things on the horizon for us to explore together soon. I’ll be sure to let you know when I have something to share!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_12_0
TEXT: Well hello, %PLAYERNAME%! Welcome back. It’s around this time of year that nights in the Northern Hemisphere begin growing longer and longer. The sun shines brighter while it’s up, though, so it’s a pretty fair trade!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_12_1
TEXT: If you ask me, this is a prime opportunity to ponder the power of light and darkness—both literally and metaphorically. I wonder what darkness our little friend Hoopa has had to overcome? I have a feeling its mischievous reputation may hang over it like a shadow at times.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_12_2
TEXT: What’s more, I can’t help but wonder how and why its power was confined.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_12_3
TEXT: Pokémon are an endless source of mystery. We may never know all their secrets, but it’s a researcher’s job to shine a light into the darkest depths of the unknown and illuminate whatever answers we can!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_12_4
TEXT: For me, darkness is an opportunity to learn something new. To make discoveries! We’ve learned so much about Hoopa in our research, and in some ways, I think we may have learned a bit about ourselves, too.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_12_5
TEXT: But enough of my rambling! How about you head on out there and enjoy the light, %PLAYERNAME%? You’ve earned it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_13_0
TEXT: I’m glad to see you again, Trainer! I was out on a walk and got to thinking about your journey with Hoopa thus far.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_13_1
TEXT: It seems that Hoopa’s really taken a shine to you. Do you think it may show us more of its power soon? A professor can dream, I suppose.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_13_2
TEXT: Why don’t you check back again in a bit, %PLAYERNAME%, after you’ve spent a tad more time with Hoopa.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_14_0
TEXT: I’m glad to see you, %PLAYERNAME%. I wish I had better news, but it looks like Team GO Rocket is stirring up trouble once again!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_14_1
TEXT: While out on patrol, Spark and Candela overheard some Team GO Rocket Grunts discussing the organization’s next move. They want to capture Hoopa! It seems their orders came straight from Giovanni himself.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_14_2
TEXT: I shudder to think that all this time Giovanni may have been lurking in the shadows just behind us, reaping the benefits of our research. Scheming as we studied Hoopa...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_14_3
TEXT: There’s no time to lose—we have to stop them! Hoopa Unbound is incredibly powerful, and I have no doubt that Giovanni intends to use it for some sinister purpose.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_14_4
TEXT: You know better than most, %PLAYERNAME%: Hoopa may be capable of terrifying things, but it’s still a Pokémon. It must be protected!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_14_5
TEXT: We’ve also gotten word that Giovanni has turned another Legendary Pokémon into a Shadow Pokémon! The team leaders and I will do what we can, but we’ll need your help if we’re to defeat Giovanni, save the Legendary Shadow Pokémon, and keep Hoopa safe.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_15_0
TEXT: Incredible work, %PLAYERNAME%! You’ve successfully defeated Team GO Rocket yet again and saved another Legendary Shadow Pokémon—and Hoopa, too!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_15_1
TEXT: Speaking of Hoopa, I have a sneaking suspicion that because of your kindness, we might just be lucky enough to witness it as Hoopa Unbound someday soon. What a sight that will be, eh?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_15_2
TEXT: We’ve come a long way in our research, and unlocking Hoopa’s true power may be the final trial in this mysterious saga. Are you ready, Trainer? Let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_6_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I’ve noticed that some Pokémon wearing costumes have been appearing around my lab lately. Isn’t it fun to change up your look every once in a while?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_6_1
TEXT: Speaking of, have you encountered any Furfrou yet? Also known as the Poodle Pokémon, Furfrou is famous for the variety of looks it can achieve when a Trainer trims its coat—10 in all!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_6_2
TEXT: Why don’t we stay on the lookout for Furfrou and see if we can learn more about changing its appearance? Who knows—maybe we’ll learn more about other Pokémon along the way!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_7_0
TEXT: Great job catching that Furfrou, Trainer! Did you know there are also other Pokémon that’re known to change their appearance? That includes one we’ve spent a lot of time researching lately: Hoopa.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_7_1
TEXT: Hoopa is known to have two forms. So far, you and I have seen it as Hoopa Confined, but I hear its power increases astronomically when it becomes Hoopa Unbound.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_7_2
TEXT: I wonder if we’ll ever get to witness it ourselves. I suppose all we can do for now is continue our research.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_7_3
TEXT: In fact, Blanche has been receiving reports of some spooky occurrences out in the field. We’re not quite sure what the cause is, but like all things lately, we can’t rule out Hoopa’s involvement.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_7_4
TEXT: Hoopa’s no stranger to mischief, and you never know how it’ll use its rings next, so I think further investigation is in order.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_7_5
TEXT: I’ll be sure to share more details with you when I have them, %PLAYERNAME%. Now, let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_8_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! It’s nice to see a friendly face—because I’ve been seeing a lot of spooky Pokémon staring at me lately!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_8_1
TEXT: Do you think this might be Hoopa’s doing? Hoopa’s known to transport Pokémon and people to different places with its rings, so maybe that’s what’s happening here.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_8_2
TEXT: After all those Legendary Pokémon appeared during this year’s GO Fest—as well as those Pokémon first found in Galar that appeared more recently—I’d say Hoopa’s involvement here is more than likely.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_8_3
TEXT: Perhaps we can learn more about Hoopa by studying the Ghost-type Pokémon that have begun to show up nearby. Mind giving me a hand, Trainer?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_9_0
TEXT: Thanks for conducting that research, Trainer. We certainly know more than we did, but not enough to explain why these spooky occurrences are still...well, occurring.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_9_1
TEXT: Let’s do a bit more research on Ghost-type Pokémon then, shall we?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shint_0_0
TEXT: Hey there %PLAYERNAME%! Hope you’ve been well.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shint_0_1
TEXT: The strangest thing happened last night: I noticed a veritable bevy of bobbing, blinking lights bouncing around at the far end of a nearby park—but by the time I’d run over, the area was empty and dark.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shint_0_2
TEXT: I have a feeling those flickering lights may somehow be connected to an Electric-type Pokémon, but I can’t be sure!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shint_0_3
TEXT: How about we do a little investigating, hm? Maybe those Pokémon are still nearby.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shint_1_0
TEXT: Well, would you look at that! It’s Shinx, the Flash Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shint_1_1
TEXT: Considering all I’ve heard about this cute little creature, I have a theory.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shint_1_2
TEXT: Shinx sends signals to others of its kind by shaking the tip of its lit-up tail.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shint_1_3
TEXT: Last night’s anomaly was likely a group of Shinx having a chat!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shint_1_4
TEXT: Now that you’ve caught a Shinx, why don’t we do some research into its Evolution, Luxio?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shint_1_5
TEXT: Strong electricity courses through the tips of Luxio’s sharp claws. What a shocking combination! Let’s learn more about it, shall we?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shint_2_0
TEXT: Well done, %PLAYERNAME%—you’ve got yourself a Luxio!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shint_2_1
TEXT: Also known as the Spark Pokémon, Luxio can receive a bit of other Luxio’s electricity by joining their tails together.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shint_2_2
TEXT: So, Shinx can use their tails to communicate with one another, and Luxio can gather their tails together to collectively generate powerful electricity. Fascinating!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shint_2_3
TEXT: I wonder what else there is to learn about this Pokémon’s Evolutionary line. How about you evolve your Luxio and we find out for ourselves!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shint_3_0
TEXT: Ah, Luxray, the Gleam Eyes Pokémon! When its eyes gleam gold, it can spot hidden prey—even through thick walls.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shint_3_1
TEXT: But seeing through solid objects uses a lot of its electricity, so Luxray sleep for long periods of time to store up energy.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shint_3_2
TEXT: What an electrifying revelation! We’ve learned a lot about Shinx and its Evolutions, but I bet there’s still much to discover.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shint_3_3
TEXT: Despite all that hard work, it seems you’ve still got a little spark left in you—so why don’t you head back out and see what other adventures await? Let’s GO!
