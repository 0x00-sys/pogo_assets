RESOURCE ID: masterwork_lugiahoohs_dialogue_0_1
TEXT: With the team leaders’ help, we managed to pinpoint Apex Shadow Ho-Oh’s location. For reasons unknown, Team GO Rocket’s keeping the two Pokémon in separate locations.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_lugiahoohs_dialogue_0_2
TEXT: Perhaps they’ve bitten off more than they can chew with these two Legendary Pokémon? In any case, this makes things easier for us: we’ll save these Pokémon one at a time!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_lugiahoohs_dialogue_1_0

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_lugiahoohs_dialogue_1_5

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_lugiahoohs_dialogue_2_2

TEXT: And while I have you, remember how I said I’d conduct more research into Apex Shadow Ho-Oh?

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_lugiahoohs_dialogue_2_4
TEXT: Well, it turns out that if you purify it, its Sacred Fire move will become immeasurably powerful.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_lugiahoohs_dialogue_2_5
TEXT: Apex Purified Ho-Oh might be an incredible ally in our quest to save Apex Shadow Lugia.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_lugiahoohs_dialogue_2_6

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_lugiahoohs_dialogue_3_5
TEXT: I bet—like Apex Shadow Ho-Oh—if you purify it, its power will increase even more.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_lugiahoohs_dialogue_3_6

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_lugiahoohs_dialogue_3_7
TEXT: Your recent accomplishments are no small feat!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_lugiahoohs_dialogue_3_8

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_0_0
TEXT: Hello there, %PLAYERNAME%! Look around—have you ever seen so many Bulbasaur?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_0_1
TEXT: Personally, I’ve only witnessed a gathering like this once before. It was some time ago, and there were so many Trainers out and about catching all the little Seed Pokémon they could find.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_0_2
TEXT: In fact, seeing all these Bulbasaur has me feeling quite nostalgic!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_0_3
TEXT: It also reminded me of an important scientific tenet: there’s always more to learn! And I never tire of researching Pokémon, no matter the species.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_0_4
TEXT: In that spirit, what do you say we do some research on Bulbasaur, Trainer?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, Trainer. That’s a downright adorable Bulbasaur you’ve caught!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_1_1
TEXT: Did you know that Bulbasaur uses the nutrients that are stored in the seed on its back to grow?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_1_2
TEXT: I’d love to have a built-in snack backpack. It would keep my stomach quiet in the field, that’s for sure! Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_1_3
TEXT: As you may know, Bulbasaur’s Evolution—Ivysaur—gains strength when it’s exposed to sunlight.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_1_4
TEXT: That sunlight also makes the bud on its back grow larger. It would be lovely to witness that phenomenon myself, for old time’s sake.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_1_5
TEXT: While you go off and evolve your Bulbasaur, I’ll continue following this pack of Bulbasaur I’ve been observing. They appear to be on the move!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_2_0
TEXT: Goodness me, look at the size of that Ivysaur! Well done, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_2_1
TEXT: If memory serves, the bud on Ivysaur’s back produces a sweet aroma when it starts to swell, indicating the flower’s about to bloom.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_2_2
TEXT: Have you gotten a whiff of that scent yet? If you do, your Ivysaur may be getting ready to evolve!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_2_3
TEXT: Now, remember that pack of Bulbasaur I was following? A handful of Ivysaur have recently emerged from a nearby forest to join them.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_2_4
TEXT: They all seem to be heading in the same direction... But what’s their destination, I wonder? Let’s go see if we can’t dig up some answers, hm?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_3_0
TEXT: Welcome back %PLAYERNAME%. Hold on—is that a Venusaur with you?! It must be my lucky day.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_3_1
TEXT: You see, the Bulbasaur and Ivysaur I was following led me to a grove where a Venusaur was resting. There was an unusual scent in the air that seemed to calm the Pokémon that had gathered.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_3_2
TEXT: I’ve read that Venusaur sometimes produces a scent that attracts other Pokémon, so I surmised that’s what was occurring.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_3_3
TEXT: In fact, the way the Bulbasaur and Ivysaur gathered around Venusaur reminded me of how Lure Modules work to attract Pokémon via scent.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_3_4
TEXT: Now, let’s talk Venusaur. Did you know it can Mega Evolve?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_3_5
TEXT: Take this Venusaur Mega Energy and try Mega Evolving your new friend. You’ll learn more by experiencing Mega Venusaur’s power for yourself!

Until an offering is made again.”

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoppt_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoppt_0_1
TEXT: I just saw the most wonderful thing: hundreds of Hoppip are filling the sky! You’d think the clouds were pink with how many there are out there right now.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoppt_0_2
TEXT: I believe this is the perfect opportunity for us to learn more about Hoppip, the Cottonweed Pokémon, don’t you agree?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoppt_0_3
TEXT: It’s said that when Hoppip gather in fields and mountains, spring is on the way.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoppt_0_4
TEXT: Does it feel like spring yet, with all these Hoppip floating about? Let’s see about catching a few to find out more about them.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoppt_1_0
TEXT: Wow, look at all those Hoppip! Hoppip are so light that they grip the ground with their feet to keep from being blown away. They also like to huddle up and link their leaves to stay grounded as a group.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoppt_1_1
TEXT: They sure have found all sorts of clever ways to keep themselves in place.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoppt_1_2
TEXT: Hoppip can also evolve, and it’s quite the sight. Don’t take my word for it—how about you go see for yourself!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoppt_2_0
TEXT: What an adorable Skiploom, %PLAYERNAME%! Have you had a moment to study it?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoppt_2_1
TEXT: The bloom on top of its head opens and closes as the temperature fluctuates. Because Skiploom’s flower blossoms when the temperature rises, some Trainers have taken to using it as a thermometer. Isn’t that fascinating?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoppt_2_2
TEXT: In warm weather, Skiploom can also be seen floating in the air to get closer to the sun. I don’t blame it—if I could float and get a little more sunlight, I would, too!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoppt_2_3
TEXT: Did you know that Skiploom can evolve as well? Why don’t you evolve one, hm?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoppt_3_0
TEXT: Great work, %PLAYERNAME%! Looks like you’ve got yourself a Jumpluff. Jumpluff rides the winds to cross the sea and fly to foreign lands, scattering cotton spores as it goes.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoppt_3_1
TEXT: Wouldn’t it be wonderful to travel so breezily?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoppt_3_2
TEXT: On that note, you should take your new friend for a stroll—maybe bask in the sunlight together a bit, too.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoppt_3_3
TEXT: See you again soon, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_0_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, you’re not going to believe this!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_0_1
TEXT: Have you seen those Poké Ball–like Pokémon rolling about?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_0_10
TEXT: This all begs the question: why are Hisuian Voltorb appearing now after being absent for so long? Did they somehow travel to the present from the Sinnoh region of the past?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_0_11
TEXT: I have a theory that when Team GO Rocket broke open the mysterious door, it somehow caused these Hisuian Voltorb to appear in our time.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_0_12
TEXT: Now why am I suddenly reminded of Celebi, the Time Travel Pokémon...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_0_13
TEXT: Anyway, that’s all I’ve got! Kind of unbelievable, isn’t it?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_0_14
TEXT: I’m going to do some more digging on my end, and I’d love your help researching these bygone Pokémon out in the field!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_0_15
TEXT: Let’s investigate Hisuian Voltorb together.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_0_2
TEXT: They look an awful lot like Voltorb—a Pokémon native to the Kanto region, among others—but I’ve never seen any Voltorb quite like these.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_0_3
TEXT: I reached out to everyone I could think of and pored over all the research documents I could get my hands on, but get this: nothing in modern scholarship mentions this Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_0_4
TEXT: However, I did eventually find something. Did you know that the Sinnoh region used to be known as the Hisui region?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_0_5
TEXT: Well, I found historical documentation of an old-fashioned Poké Ball developed long ago in the Hisui region, and I realized it greatly resembles this mysterious Pokémon. Or could it be the other way around?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_0_6
TEXT: Which came first: the Poké Ball or the Pokémon? Who knows!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_0_7
TEXT: Taking all this into consideration, I believe this anomalous Pokémon is, in fact, a Voltorb that once lived in the Hisui region.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_0_8
TEXT: Is it still a regional variant if it only existed in the past? Gosh, what a puzzle.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_0_9
TEXT: For now, I suppose we may as well call this Pokémon Hisuian Voltorb.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_1_0
TEXT: I’m still reeling, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_1_1
TEXT: Can you believe Pokémon from a different time are now appearing around us?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_1_10
TEXT: Anyway. Our research sure has been exciting lately, hasn’t it, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_1_11
TEXT: Something tells me we’re in for even more exciting discoveries!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_1_12
TEXT: Let’s keep at it and see what else our adventure together brings.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_1_2
TEXT: I wonder what this Pokémon has seen in the Hisui region—and what it thinks of the future it’s suddenly seeing now!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_1_3
TEXT: Ah, the Hisui region... I wonder what other kinds of Pokémon lived there.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_1_4
TEXT: What I wouldn’t give to go back in time and experience the Hisui region for myself! It’d be a dream come true!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_1_5
TEXT: Maybe if I ever meet Celebi, I could ask it for a quick trip back in time, just to sate my curiosity!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_1_6
TEXT: ...But I’m sure that’s not possible. It’s nice to dream, though!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_1_7
TEXT: Anyway, I’ve decided to research whether Hisuian Voltorb can evolve.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_1_8
TEXT: I haven’t the foggiest if it can, but that won’t stop me. I want to learn everything about this strange and wonderful Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_1_9
TEXT: After all, it’s not every day that a literal blast from the past falls into your lap! Get it? Because Voltorb can Self-Destruct? Haha...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! It’s great to see you again.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_0_1
TEXT: I wanted to tell you about what I saw on my morning walk today—a herd of Spheal rolling across an icy lake!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_0_2
TEXT: Did you know that a Spheal always travels by rolling around on its ball-like body?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_0_3
TEXT: When the season for ice floes arrives, Spheal can be seen rolling about on ice and crossing the sea.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_0_4
TEXT: They’re also covered in fluffy fur to keep them from feeling cold in icy climes. And I’ll tell you, seeing them tumble to-and-fro warmed me right up, too!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_0_5
TEXT: Why don’t you go check out some Spheal for yourself?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! I see you’ve brought some Spheal with you. Aren’t they just the roundest?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_1_1
TEXT: According to my research, the Evolution of Spheal, Sealeo, seems to agree! Sealeo can occasionally be seen entertaining itself by balancing a Spheal on its nose as if juggling a ball.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_1_2
TEXT: In fact, when Sealeo sees just about anything for the first time, it tends to try juggling it on its nose! Why don’t you evolve your Spheal and see for yourself?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_2_0
TEXT: Welcome back, Trainer—and hello there, Sealeo!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_2_1
TEXT: I have some breaking news for you. Remember that icy lake I told you about earlier?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_2_2
TEXT: Well, it looks like something’s broken it up, and now all the Spheal are splashing around in the water! They seem to be having fun, but I wonder what Pokémon could have caused this.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_2_3
TEXT: My best guess is Walrein. Walrein is known to swim through frigid water while crushing icebergs with its grand, imposing tusks. Sounds pretty magnificent, if a bit imposing.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_2_4
TEXT: Can you evolve your Sealeo so we can research Walrein ourselves?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_3_0
TEXT: You did it, Trainer! Walrein’s tusks really are magnificent up close, aren’t they?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_3_1
TEXT: Did you know that Walrein typically gather in herds of about 20 or 30? When a threat appears, the herd’s leader will do whatever it takes to protect the group.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_3_2
TEXT: Nice to know they can look after themselves—though considering those tusks, I don’t think that was ever in doubt. Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_3_3
TEXT: I’m sure your Walrein will protect you in battle as well. You already look like quite a powerful pair!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_3_4
TEXT: Thanks for going on this adventure with me today, %PLAYERNAME%! I’ve learned a lot from the research you conducted. Until next time, let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_0_1
TEXT: That’s right—today we’re learning all about the Johto region and meeting some Pokémon originally discovered there, too!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_0_10
TEXT: But nothing’s happened yet, so you just focus on having fun with your friends and your Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_0_2
TEXT: The Johto region is a land steeped in history and tradition, where the bygone beauty of Ecruteak City lies just steps away from the modern metropolis of Goldenrod City.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_0_3
TEXT: It’s also the region where Dark- and Steel-type Pokémon were first discovered! Not to mention Mr. Pokémon and the mysterious Mystery Egg.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_0_4
TEXT: Speaking of Pokémon originally discovered in the Johto region, I’ve heard tell that Celebi, the Time Travel Pokémon, has been seen nearby.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_0_5
TEXT: Celebi has the ability to move through time.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_0_6
TEXT: Once again, I just can’t shake the feeling that Celebi had something to do with Hisuian Voltorb appearing in our time.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_0_7
TEXT: In any case, rumor has it this Celebi knows a special move. I hope we’ll get a chance to see if that’s true!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_0_8
TEXT: While you enjoy today’s festivities, keep vigilant for any signs of Team GO Rocket. I know I haven’t forgotten about them.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_0_9
TEXT: Hopefully we can get some insight into what they’ve been up to since they smashed open the mysterious door...

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_1_0
TEXT: You know what your adventure needs, %PLAYERNAME%? A new buddy! I spoke with a colleague and was able to orchestrate a little surprise for you.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_1_1
TEXT: These Pokémon are the first partner Pokémon offered to Trainers in the Johto region. Go on. Pick one!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_2_0
TEXT: I think that’s a great Pokémon, too, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_2_1_chikorita
TEXT: Chikorita, the Leaf Pokémon, is docile and loves to soak up the sun’s rays. A sweet aroma gently wafts from the leaf on its head. Doesn’t it have just the most adorable face?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_2_1_cyndaquil
TEXT: Cyndaquil, the Fire Mouse Pokémon, is timid and always curls itself up in a ball. If attacked, it flares up its back for protection. Doesn’t its shyness make you want to cuddle it even more?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_2_1_totodile
TEXT: Totodile, the Big Jaw Pokémon, is small but rough and tough. It won’t hesitate to take a bite out of anything that moves. Though what’s the harm in one quick pet...

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_2_2
TEXT: I’m sure this little one is eager to spend some time with you, and what better way than letting it join you on your Johto journey!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_3_0_chikorita

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_3_2
TEXT: I have a feeling they’re stirring up more than just a mild bit of mischief... That must be why they’re launching an invasion—more distractions! Not to mention they always love to crash our parties.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_3_3
TEXT: Have they heard about the Celebi sightings? Or maybe they have something even more sinister up their sleeve...

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_3_4
TEXT: I’m going to need your help defeating some Team GO Rocket Grunts—distract the distraction, and buy me some time to investigate. Can I count on your help?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_4_0

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_4_1
TEXT: I assume you’re the Trainer in question? Incredible. I knew I could trust you.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_4_2
TEXT: So, my sleuthing turned up an interesting rumor. A Gyarados has been spotted nearby, but it isn’t at all like your typical Gyarados.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_4_3
TEXT: This one seems like it’s mired in a fit of rage—not unlike a certain Red Gyarados that once rampaged the Johto region’s Lake of Rage.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_4_4
TEXT: Back then, Team Rocket used a mysterious radio broadcast to force Magikarp to evolve.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_4_5
TEXT: Hm. Now doesn’t that sound familiar... Just like Shadow Pokémon... And there have been a lot more of them appearing lately. Could Team GO Rocket be using the same technology again?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_4_6
TEXT: And how does this connect with what they stole from behind the mysterious door? What if it was some sort of power that they’ve now amplified and corrupted...?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_4_7
TEXT: And with Celebi about and its time travel powers— Egad! Who knows what Team GO Rocket could do! There’s no time to waste. Let’s save Gyarados and then set our sights on finding Celebi before it’s too late!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_5_0
TEXT: Great work, %PLAYERNAME%! That Gyarados is much calmer now that you’ve rescued it from Team GO Rocket.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_5_1

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_8_3

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_8_4
TEXT: It gets worse: using the power they stole from behind the mysterious door in conjunction with radio technology developed via their past broadcasts, they’ve forced Lugia and Ho-Oh to ascend to a level of power beyond any Shadow Pokémon we’ve ever seen.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_8_5
