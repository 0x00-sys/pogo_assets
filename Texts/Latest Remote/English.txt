RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_0_0
TEXT: Hey, %PLAYERNAME%! Have you run into any Pokémon wearing fun costumes recently? I’ve seen quite a few around my mobile lab.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_0_1
TEXT: It reminded me how freeing it can be to express yourself in different ways. Personally, I’m a big fan of turning up my tunes and shredding on the air guitar!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_0_2
TEXT: Others, like Spark, are really into taking snapshots of Pokémon and the world around them. I wonder how those Pokémon feel when they wear those costumes.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_0_3
TEXT: Sounds to me like some research is in order!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, Trainer! I was digging through some old files while you were out when I began to hear a strange melody coming from somewhere nearby.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_1_1
TEXT: I ran out to investigate, and in my haste, I ended up bumping straight into Blanche, who’d been sorting through some Berries.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_1_2
TEXT: Blanche was none too pleased to see those Berries scattered on the ground, but the costumed Pokémon who rushed in to gobble them up sure seemed thankful. Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_1_3
TEXT: Seeing them relish those Berries gave me an idea. Cooking food can be a terrific way to express yourself, and giving food to those we care about is one of the most heartfelt things we do for one another.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_1_4
TEXT: I wonder how different Pokémon react to different foods? While I go on a Berry run, why don’t you do some research on how Pokémon feel after eating?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_2_0
TEXT: Thanks for completing those research tasks, Trainer! Reading the results of your research made my heart full—and my stomach rumbly! Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_2_1
TEXT: Ah, by the way! I heard that mysterious melody again while I was collecting Berries. I think it may be the product of a certain Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_2_2
TEXT: I wasn’t able to look into it further at the time—my hands were quite full with Berries—but I’m hoping we can investigate it together soon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_2_3
TEXT: For now, could you continue researching how people and Pokémon express themselves?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_2_4
TEXT: For many Trainers and their Pokémon, battling is a primary outlet of self-expression. In fact, Candela believes that the feelings she shares with her Pokémon can directly influence the outcome of a battle.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_2_5
TEXT: Why don’t you go out and see for yourself? I’ll be cheering you on from here!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_3_0
TEXT: Welcome back, Trainer. Did you learn anything about expressing yourself in battle?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_3_1
TEXT: While you were out, I managed to track that mysterious melody to a location nearby. I think the source may be none other than Meloetta, the Melody Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_3_2
TEXT: Did you know that its melodies are sung with a special vocalization method that can control the feelings of those who hear it?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_3_3
TEXT: Maybe if we find a way to express ourselves through song as well, you’ll be able to catch Meloetta’s attention! What do you say, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_4_0
TEXT: Well done, %PLAYERNAME%! I knew you’d find a way to catch Meloetta’s attention.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_4_1
TEXT: They say many famous songs have been inspired by the melodies that Meloetta produces, and it’s not hard to see why. Self-expression through song is a truly powerful thing!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_4_2
TEXT: I think this would be a fine opportunity for you to partner with Meloetta and share who you are with your friends. I’m sure Meloetta would be happy to learn more about you, too!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_5_0
TEXT: Da da da dooo... Da dee doo, dee da dee dum...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_5_1
TEXT: Oh, %PLAYERNAME%—I didn’t see you there! I was just rocking out to one of my favorite songs. After so much research on how people express themselves, I felt compelled to indulge in a bit of self-expression myself!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_5_2
TEXT: Whether it’s serving looks or serving lunch, a Pokémon battle or battle of the bands, there’s no limit to the ways you can express who you are. What’s your method of choice, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_5_3
TEXT: Maybe you’re still figuring it out—and that’s totally fine. Everyone’s journey is unique! Whatever the case, you have my support—and Meloetta’s, too. Now, let’s get out there and show the world who we are!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_oshat_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I’m hoping you can help me with something. You see, I was out for a walk recently and noticed several trees covered in slash marks—and I think I know what made them.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_oshat_0_1
TEXT: There’s a Pokémon called Oshawott—the Sea Otter Pokémon—that keeps a scalchop on its stomach that it can detach and use as a blade. I’ve seen a lot of Oshawott around lately, so I’m thinking they may be our mystery tree carvers.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_oshat_0_2
TEXT: Could you catch some Oshawott so we can learn more about them?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_oshat_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! Did you know that Oshawott uses the scalchop on its stomach not only to fight but also to break open hard berries? Gotta love a good multitool.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_oshat_1_1
TEXT: Now that we’ve learned more about Oshawott, I was hoping we could turn our attention to its Evolution, Dewott. Don’t let its cute appearance fool you—Dewott takes itself very seriously.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_oshat_1_2
TEXT: Also known as the Discipline Pokémon, Dewott uses strict training to learn its flowing double-scalchop technique. I’d love to see Dewott’s fighting in action! Can you evolve your Oshawott for me, Trainer?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_oshat_2_0
TEXT: Wow, Dewott’s double-scalchop technique is incredible! Pokémon truly never cease to amaze, eh, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_oshat_2_1
TEXT: I barely have the coordination to rub my tummy and pat my head at the same time, and here we have Pokémon mastering bespoke battle techniques. It’s inspiring stuff!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_oshat_2_2
TEXT: I think I’ve gained a better understanding of Dewott—which means we can begin studying its Evolution.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_oshat_2_3
TEXT: Dewott’s Evolution, Samurott, is known to wield swords called seamitars incorporated in its armor. Apparently, Samurott can draw and sheathe its seamitars in the time it takes a foe to blink.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_oshat_2_4
TEXT: Not hard to see why it’s known as the Formidable Pokémon! Why don’t you evolve Dewott so we can witness Samurott’s majesty for ourselves?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_oshat_3_0
TEXT: Excellent work, Trainer! That’s a fine Samurott. Its seamitars truly are a sight to behold! Knowing how quickly it can draw and sheathe its blades, I wonder how fast it can dice up berries...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_oshat_3_1
TEXT: Thanks for all your help today, %PLAYERNAME%. We’ve learned so much about Oshawott, Dewott, and Samurott—and from them, too! I’ll “sea” you next time! Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I’m glad you’re here. A new adventure is about to begin!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_0_1
TEXT: Not long ago, various Legendary Pokémon began emerging from mysterious rings that suddenly appeared in the sky. After some research, we discovered it was Hoopa, the Mischief Pokémon, that was responsible.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_0_2
TEXT: Hoopa’s rings allow it to teleport things—including itself—wherever it wants. That power makes it hard to track down, but for some reason, Hoopa seems to keep returning to this area.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_0_3
TEXT: How do I know? Well, I was doing some lab work recently when my glasses were lifted straight off my head. Spark was there assisting me, and he said he saw a small, lavender-colored hand emerge from a ring and snatch my glasses. Pretty cheeky, eh?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_0_4
TEXT: Luckily, he and Candela managed to retrieve my spectacles by chasing down the rings that were popping up at random around my mobile lab. So, at least I can still see. Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_0_5
TEXT: Needless to say, I’m still not sure why Hoopa’s here. Tracking it down has been difficult, but with your help, I’m sure we’ll crack the case in no time!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_0_6
TEXT: For now, why don’t you try using an Incense to see what Pokémon you can find in the area?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_1_0
TEXT: As with all great mysteries, solving this will take time, patience, and trust. I’ll need to work alone at some points, but I promise I’ll return to share my findings and help propel us forward.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_1_1
TEXT: You just keep exploring the world as you always do. You never know what you might find!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_1_2
TEXT: I’ll report back here once I have more information on Hoopa. Thanks in advance for your help, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_2_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! It’s so good to see you again. Have you managed to spot Hoopa anywhere?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_2_1
TEXT: Although some think of Hoopa as a mischievous troublemaker, really all it wants to do is have fun!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_2_2
TEXT: Speaking of fun, it seems Hoopa had a blast filling up my mobile lab with Pinap Berries. Maybe it spotted me happily digging into some during my lunch break and decided I could use a few more.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_2_3
TEXT: It was a bit of a surprise when I opened the lab door and piles of Pinap Berries poured out! It took a while to clean everything up—but my lab did smell amazing afterward, so it wasn’t all bad.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_2_4
TEXT: It was nice having an excuse to clean—not to mention I have enough Pinap Berries to last me for days. I might even make some jam...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_2_5
TEXT: Anyway, Hoopa sure has seemed a lot friendlier these days, hasn’t it? I think it’s been having lots of fun interacting with us. Maybe that’s why it’s been bringing all sorts of surprises into our world.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_2_6
TEXT: Who knows—you might be able to catch it now!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_3_0
TEXT: Wow, %PLAYERNAME%! I can't believe you caught Hoopa!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_3_1
TEXT: Normally I’d say we’re done with our research, but I wouldn’t be surprised if Hoopa continued to cause mischief.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_3_2
TEXT: It seems there’s still much for us to learn about this Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_3_3
TEXT: By the way, I’ve noticed that some Psychic-type Pokémon have been appearing around my lab. Could Hoopa’s presence be the cause?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_3_4
TEXT: Perhaps we’ll be able to use this as an opportunity to research Psychic-type Pokémon, including Hoopa. I’ll have to investigate this phenomenon further, and I’ll let you know when I’ve learned more. Until next time!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_4_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I’ve noticed an increase in the number of Psychic-type Pokémon appearing around my mobile lab of late.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_4_1
TEXT: Whenever something like this happens, I can’t help but get excited about researching the cause!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_4_2
TEXT: As you may recall, the Mythical Pokémon Hoopa is a Psychic and Ghost type. I have a hunch its recent appearances might be causing the uptick in Psychic-type Pokémon in these parts.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_4_3
TEXT: What’s more, I believe we may be able to learn more about Hoopa by researching other Psychic-type Pokémon. There’s one in particular that’s caught my attention: Inkay.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_4_4
TEXT: My colleague in the Kalos region told me that Inkay is known as the Revolving Pokémon, and that it evolves in a unique way.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_4_5
TEXT: I’m ashamed to say I’ve forgotten the details, but I do remember him saying “upside-down” several times during his explanation. If only I could remember why...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_4_6
TEXT: Maybe it’s my one-track mind speaking, but I immediately think of Hoopa when I hear “upside-down”—because its appearance turned our world right on its head! Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_5_0
TEXT: Hey, Trainer! Have you noticed that Hoopa has continued to cause mischief? Its tricks are always unexpected, but I do feel like Hoopa’s brought some welcome color to our lives.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_5_1
TEXT: Speaking of colorful things, I’ve heard reports that there’s a certain Pokémon nearby that’s known to have multiple appearances. Keep your eyes peeled for me, won’t you?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_5_2
TEXT: In the meantime, I’m going to analyze everything we’ve learned about Psychic-type Pokémon thus far. Hopefully it’ll point us in the right direction to continue our research on Pokémon forms—and Hoopa!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_6_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I’ve noticed that some Pokémon wearing costumes have been appearing around my lab lately. Isn’t it fun to change up your look every once in a while?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_6_1
TEXT: Speaking of, have you encountered any Furfrou yet? Also known as the Poodle Pokémon, Furfrou is famous for the variety of looks it can achieve when a Trainer trims its coat—10 in all!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_6_2
TEXT: Why don’t we stay on the lookout for Furfrou and see if we can learn more about changing its appearance? Who knows—maybe we’ll learn more about other Pokémon along the way!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_7_0
TEXT: Great job catching that Furfrou, Trainer! Did you know there are also other Pokémon that’re known to change their appearance? That includes one we’ve spent a lot of time researching lately: Hoopa.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_7_1
TEXT: Hoopa is known to have two forms. So far, you and I have seen it as Hoopa Confined, but I hear its power increases astronomically when it becomes Hoopa Unbound.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_7_2
TEXT: I wonder if we’ll ever get to witness it ourselves. I suppose all we can do for now is continue our research.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_7_3
TEXT: In fact, Blanche has been receiving reports of some spooky occurrences out in the field. We’re not quite sure what the cause is, but like all things lately, we can’t rule out Hoopa’s involvement.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_7_4
TEXT: Hoopa’s no stranger to mischief, and you never know how it’ll use its rings next, so I think further investigation is in order.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_7_5
TEXT: I’ll be sure to share more details with you when I have them, %PLAYERNAME%. Now, let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_0_3
TEXT: The first few times I saw it, I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me, but as the motions grew more frequent, I began to suspect a Pokémon was involved.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_0_1
TEXT: I was just thinking that it’d be interesting to research more about my Buddy Pokémon and the team leaders’ buddies.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_2_0
TEXT: Excellent work, %PLAYERNAME%. It looks like you have your very own Lapras, just like Blanche!
