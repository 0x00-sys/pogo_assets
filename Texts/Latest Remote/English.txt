RESOURCE ID: arlo_challenge#1
TEXT: Why do you insist on wasting my time?

RESOURCE ID: arlo_challenge#10
TEXT: You lack the gravitas to be in the presence of Team GO Rocket. I’ll finish this quickly.

RESOURCE ID: arlo_challenge#2
TEXT: Well, if you insist on battling, as a Trainer, I must accept. However, you will pay for inconveniencing me.

RESOURCE ID: arlo_challenge#3
TEXT: You have such an air of arrogance about you. Allow me to dispel it for you.

RESOURCE ID: arlo_challenge#4
TEXT: Your insolence disgusts me. I’ll make sure your confidence is utterly shattered following this battle.

RESOURCE ID: arlo_challenge#5

RESOURCE ID: arlo_challenge#6

RESOURCE ID: arlo_greeting#5
TEXT: Team GO Rocket’s domination is inevitable. Submit and you may be spared.

RESOURCE ID: arlo_greeting#6
TEXT: Pokémon are our tools. We are entitled to power them up as we so choose. Commoners such as yourself would never understand.

RESOURCE ID: arlo_greeting#7
TEXT: My sole purpose in life is to win. I’ll vanquish whoever dares to get in my way.

RESOURCE ID: arlo_greeting#8
TEXT: Oh, do YOU think you can beat me? Someone of your standing? Hah!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_lugiahoohs_dialogue_0_1
TEXT: With the team leaders’ help, we managed to pinpoint Apex Shadow Ho-Oh’s location. For reasons unknown, Team GO Rocket’s keeping the two Pokémon in separate locations.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_lugiahoohs_dialogue_0_2
TEXT: Perhaps they’ve bitten off more than they can chew with these two Legendary Pokémon? In any case, this makes things easier for us: we’ll save these Pokémon one at a time!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_lugiahoohs_dialogue_1_0

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_lugiahoohs_dialogue_2_4

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_1_0

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_1_1

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_1_2
TEXT: Haha! Seriously though, it’s something I’m looking into.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_1_3
TEXT: For now, let’s have a look at the Pokémon you’ve caught.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_1_4
TEXT: Hmm, how curious. You appear to have caught several Pokémon that are often found on Alola’s Akala Island.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_1_5
TEXT: Akala Island has some amazing geographical features that make it a suitable habitat for a wide range of Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_1_6
TEXT: There’s Brooklet Hill, a fantastic fishing spot with a series of cascading waterfalls. And Lush Jungle, where trees grow densely together, as well as Wela Volcano Park—which, as you may have guessed, is a volcano!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_1_7
TEXT: How about keeping an eye out for Fire-, Water-, and Grass-type Pokémon while you’re out, %PLAYERNAME%? If my hunch is correct, you may run into more Pokémon often seen about Akala Island.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_2_0
TEXT: Well done, %PLAYERNAME%! That’s quite an assortment of Pokémon you’ve encountered.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_2_1
TEXT: I wish I’d been out there with you, but I wasn’t sitting idly by! I think I may have discovered why the air seems to be sparkling today.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_2_2
TEXT: You see, Blanche just reported witnessing a mysterious pink Pokémon behind a flower bush.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_2_3
TEXT: Based on its description, I believe Blanche may have seen Tapu Lele, the guardian deity of Akala Island.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_2_4
TEXT: The fragrant aroma of flowers is the source of Tapu Lele’s energy. Perhaps that has something to do with why the flowers smell so sweet today.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_2_5
TEXT: Spark and Blanche have both seen guardian deities now... Hmm. While I chew on that, let’s get out and look for Tapu Lele, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_3_0
TEXT: Whew! That was a good walk. I just got back myself, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_3_1
TEXT: I wasn’t able to find Tapu Lele, but I did manage to get a closer look at some of the sparkles I’ve been seeing in the air.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_3_2
TEXT: They appear to be the glowing scales Tapu Lele is known to scatter. Touching them is said to restore good health on the spot.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_3_3
TEXT: How did you fare during your investigation, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_3_4
TEXT: *gasp* You saw Tapu Lele?! That’s incredible!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_3_5
TEXT: So, we’ve been visited by two of Alola’s guardian deities now... What could they be here for, I wonder?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_3_6
TEXT: Tapu Lele is said to be guilelessly cruel, so I do hope we’re staying on its good side.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_3_7
TEXT: If I could just meet one of the guardian deities myself, it would help me form a solid hypothesis as to why they’re appearing...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_3_8
TEXT: But that’s for me to ponder. Don’t trouble yourself with it—go out and enjoy the day! I’ll be in touch soon. Let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoppt_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoppt_0_1
TEXT: I just saw the most wonderful thing: hundreds of Hoppip are filling the sky! You’d think the clouds were pink with how many there are out there right now.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoppt_0_2
TEXT: I believe this is the perfect opportunity for us to learn more about Hoppip, the Cottonweed Pokémon, don’t you agree?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoppt_0_3
TEXT: It’s said that when Hoppip gather in fields and mountains, spring is on the way.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoppt_0_4
TEXT: Does it feel like spring yet, with all these Hoppip floating about? Let’s see about catching a few to find out more about them.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoppt_1_0
TEXT: Wow, look at all those Hoppip! Hoppip are so light that they grip the ground with their feet to keep from being blown away. They also like to huddle up and link their leaves to stay grounded as a group.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoppt_1_1
TEXT: They sure have found all sorts of clever ways to keep themselves in place.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoppt_1_2
TEXT: Hoppip can also evolve, and it’s quite the sight. Don’t take my word for it—how about you go see for yourself!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoppt_2_0
TEXT: What an adorable Skiploom, %PLAYERNAME%! Have you had a moment to study it?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoppt_2_1
TEXT: The bloom on top of its head opens and closes as the temperature fluctuates. Because Skiploom’s flower blossoms when the temperature rises, some Trainers have taken to using it as a thermometer. Isn’t that fascinating?

TEXT: In warm weather, Skiploom can also be seen floating in the air to get closer to the sun. I don’t blame it—if I could float and get a little more sunlight, I would, too!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoppt_2_3
TEXT: Did you know that Skiploom can evolve as well? Why don’t you evolve one, hm?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoppt_3_0
TEXT: Great work, %PLAYERNAME%! Looks like you’ve got yourself a Jumpluff. Jumpluff rides the winds to cross the sea and fly to foreign lands, scattering cotton spores as it goes.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoppt_3_1
TEXT: Wouldn’t it be wonderful to travel so breezily?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoppt_3_2
TEXT: On that note, you should take your new friend for a stroll—maybe bask in the sunlight together a bit, too.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoppt_3_3
TEXT: See you again soon, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! It’s great to see you, as always.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_0_1
TEXT: I’m feeling especially refreshed today, as if a pleasant island breeze were following me. Maybe it’s the freshly squeezed Pinap Juice I had for breakfast?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_0_2
TEXT: Or maybe it’s because more and more Pokémon first discovered in the Alola region have been coming to visit me lately!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_0_3
TEXT: Do you know about the Alola region, %PLAYERNAME%? It’s a cluster of tropical islands, each with unique scenery and Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_0_4
TEXT: Alola even has Pokémon whose appearances are different than their counterparts in other regions. You may have encountered some of them before!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_0_5
TEXT: Why don’t you try looking for some Pokémon that were first discovered in Alola while I rustle up another glass of juice? I’m sure we have a lot to learn about our visitors!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_1_0
TEXT: Good timing, %PLAYERNAME%! I just finished my juice.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_1_1
TEXT: Thanks for looking into the Alola region’s Pokémon! You’re as diligent as ever.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_1_2
TEXT: Let me take a look at what you’ve discovered. Hmm... It seems many of the Pokémon you just met can be found on Alola’s Melemele Island.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_1_3
TEXT: Melemele Island is where many of Alola’s Trainers begin their island challenge. It’s very fitting that the Pokémon you just met are also some of the first that young Trainers in Alola meet, too!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_1_4
TEXT: Now, let’s have a little more fun! Could you take a few snapshots of your new Pokémon friends or feed them some Berries, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_2_0
TEXT: Back already, %PLAYERNAME%? You and your Pokémon already seem to be closer. But who doesn’t love a good Pinap Berry? Speaking of, maybe it’s time for another glass of juice...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_2_1
TEXT: Delicious juice aside, did you know that each island in the Alola region has its own Island Guardian? Melemele Island’s guardian deity is Tapu Koko.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_2_2
TEXT: Why do I bring this up? Well, while you were away, I was looking for a clean glass and caught a startling yellow flash out of the corner of my eye!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_2_3
TEXT: The lightning-wielding Tapu Koko is known to fly faster than the eye can follow. With so many other Pokémon found on Melemele Island appearing, could it be that Tapu Koko is visiting as well?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_2_4
TEXT: Could you look around and see if you can spot Tapu Koko, %PLAYERNAME%? I’m eager to know if what I saw was truly the Land Spirit Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_3_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! What’s that? You were able to see Tapu Koko? That’s incredible!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_3_1
TEXT: And would you believe it: Spark was just here, raving that he’d seen Tapu Koko, too! So it is in the area after all. What an exceptional discovery, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_3_2
TEXT: I wonder why Tapu Koko is here. Tapu Koko is said to be a Pokémon brimming with curiosity—but, naturally, Island Guardians tend to stay on their respective islands. The fact that one of them is here may mean something is amiss...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_3_3
TEXT: Or did someone do something to anger it? I’ll have to do some more research before I can say anything for sure.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_3_4
TEXT: Do you think we’ll get a chance to meet the other Island Guardians, %PLAYERNAME%? Wouldn’t that be something.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_3_5
TEXT: I guess we’ll just have to wait and see. Until then, let’s kick back and enjoy a little R and R with our new friends!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_8_7
TEXT: You’ll never know what you’re capable of until you try, right?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_0_0
TEXT: Good morning, %PLAYERNAME%! There sure seems to be a surplus of Sandshrew around today, don’t you think?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_0_1
TEXT: I’m especially surprised to see both Sandshrew and Alolan Sandshrew appearing at once!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_0_2
TEXT: These two forms of Sandshrew usually prefer vastly different climates. Sandshrew usually make their homes in deserts and arid zones, where rain doesn’t fall.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_0_3
TEXT: Alolan Sandshrew, on the other hand, are typically found in snowy mountains. What an uncommon sight for them to both be here together!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_0_4
TEXT: How about you spend some time with them and see what they’re up to, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! That’s an impressive number of Sandshrew you have in tow. I’d love to take a closer look at them—especially their shells.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_1_1
TEXT: Did you know that there’s a traditional competition in Alolan festivals where Trainers slide Alolan Sandshrew across ice as far as possible?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_1_2
TEXT: How must the Sandshrew feel about that, I wonder!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_1_3
TEXT: The Sandshrew first found in the Kanto region are quite fascinating in their own right.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_1_4
TEXT: When their shells are wrinkled from moisture, they head for volcanoes and lie flat on a spot with a lot of geothermal heat to dry themselves out.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_1_5
TEXT: It’s truly incredible how different geography and climates can influence Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_1_6
TEXT: I’d love to get an even closer look at both of these forms of Sandshrew. What do you say, %PLAYERNAME%? Let’s get back out there!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_2_0
TEXT: You never disappoint, %PLAYERNAME%! Seeing all the Sandshrew together, don’t they look like a tough bunch?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_2_1
TEXT: Sandshrew evolve into Sandslash, another hardy Pokémon. Alolan Sandslash use their large, hooked claws to cut paths through deep snow as they run.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_2_2
TEXT: On snowy mountains, these Sandslash are faster than any other Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_2_3
TEXT: But Sandslash first found in Kanto are tough, too! They climb trees by hooking on with their sharp claws.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_2_4
TEXT: They even share the Berries they gather by dropping them down to Sandshrew waiting on the ground. If only I could gather Berries so easily...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_2_5
TEXT: Try and evolve Sandshrew to Sandslash for yourself, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_3_0
TEXT: Great work, %PLAYERNAME%. Your new Sandslash are an impressive sight—befitting an impressive Trainer such as yourself!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_3_1
TEXT: Up close, you can really appreciate the differences in the spikes of these Sandslash.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_3_2
TEXT: The drier the area Sandslash lives in, the harder and smoother their spikes feel.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_3_3
TEXT: Meanwhile, Alolan Sandslash have beautiful icy spikes that glisten in the light of dawn.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_3_4
TEXT: Thanks for helping me look into these Sandshrew today, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_3_5
TEXT: I’ll keep studying Sandshrew and Sandslash in hopes of discovering more differences and similarities between them!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_3_6
TEXT: And I’ll be sure to get in touch the next time I need a helping hand. Something tells me it won’t be long!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_3_7
TEXT: Until next time, let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_10_5
TEXT: It didn’t take long for me to realize I was standing before a Trevenant, the Elder Tree Pokémon. Trevenant will trap people who harm their forest, never allowing them to leave.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_10_8
TEXT: Ghost-type Pokémon can seem frightening at first glance, but look a little closer and you’ll find they’re full of surprises. I’m sure the same goes for Hoopa!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_0_1
TEXT: That’s right—today we’re learning all about the Johto region and meeting some Pokémon originally discovered there, too!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_0_10
TEXT: But nothing’s happened yet, so you just focus on having fun with your friends and your Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_0_2
TEXT: The Johto region is a land steeped in history and tradition, where the bygone beauty of Ecruteak City lies just steps away from the modern metropolis of Goldenrod City.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_0_3
TEXT: It’s also the region where Dark- and Steel-type Pokémon were first discovered! Not to mention Mr. Pokémon and the mysterious Mystery Egg.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_0_4
TEXT: Speaking of Pokémon originally discovered in the Johto region, I’ve heard tell that Celebi, the Time Travel Pokémon, has been seen nearby.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_0_5
TEXT: Celebi has the ability to move through time.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_0_6
TEXT: I still can’t shake the feeling that Celebi had something to do with Hisuian Voltorb appearing in our time.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_0_7
TEXT: In any case, rumor has it this Celebi knows a special move. I hope we’ll get a chance to see if that’s true!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_0_8
TEXT: While you enjoy today’s festivities, keep vigilant for any signs of Team GO Rocket. I know I haven’t forgotten about them.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_0_9
TEXT: Hopefully we can get some insight into what they’ve been up to since they smashed open that mysterious door...

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_1_0
TEXT: You know what your adventure needs, %PLAYERNAME%? A new buddy! I spoke with a colleague and was able to orchestrate a little surprise for you.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_1_1
TEXT: These Pokémon are the first partner Pokémon offered to Trainers in the Johto region. Go on—pick one!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_2_0
TEXT: I think that’s a great Pokémon, too, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_2_1_chikorita
TEXT: Chikorita, the Leaf Pokémon, is docile and loves to soak up the sun’s rays. A sweet aroma gently wafts from the leaf on its head. Doesn’t it have just the most adorable face?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_2_1_cyndaquil
TEXT: Cyndaquil, the Fire Mouse Pokémon, is timid and always curls itself up in a ball. If attacked, it flares up its back for protection. Doesn’t its shyness make you want to cuddle it even more?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_2_1_totodile
TEXT: Totodile, the Big Jaw Pokémon, is small but rough and tough. It won’t hesitate to take a bite out of anything that moves. Though what’s the harm in one quick pet...

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_2_2
TEXT: I’m sure this little one is eager to spend some time with you, and what better way than letting it join you on your Johto-inspired journey!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_3_0_chikorita
TEXT: Wow, your Chikorita evolved into Bayleef already! And just in time, %PLAYERNAME%—I have some troubling news.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_3_0_cyndaquil
TEXT: Wow, your Cyndaquil evolved into Quilava already! And just in time, %PLAYERNAME%—I have some troubling news.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_3_0_totodile
TEXT: Wow, your Totodile evolved into Croconaw already! And just in time, %PLAYERNAME%—I have some troubling news.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_3_1
TEXT: Team GO Rocket is mobilizing—and they’re headed straight toward us!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_3_2
TEXT: I have a feeling they’re stirring up more than just a mild bit of mischief... That must be why they’re launching an invasion—more distractions! Not to mention they always love to crash our parties.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_3_3
TEXT: Have they heard about the Celebi sightings? Or maybe they have something even more sinister up their sleeve...

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_3_4
TEXT: I’m going to need your help defeating some Team GO Rocket Grunts—distract the distraction, and buy me some time to investigate. Can I count on your help?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_4_0
TEXT: Magnificent work, %PLAYERNAME%! While I was investigating, some Team GO Rocket Grunts ran by, whining about losing to an “unfairly strong Trainer.”

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_4_1
TEXT: I assume you’re the Trainer in question? Haha, but of course! I knew I could trust you.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_4_2
TEXT: So, my sleuthing turned up an interesting rumor. A Gyarados has been spotted nearby, but it isn’t at all like your typical Gyarados.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_4_3
TEXT: This one seems like it’s mired in a fit of rage—not unlike a certain Red Gyarados that once rampaged the Johto region’s Lake of Rage.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_4_4
TEXT: Back then, Team Rocket used a mysterious radio broadcast to force Magikarp to evolve.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_4_5
TEXT: Hm. That sounds similar to Shadow Pokémon, don’t you think? And there have been a lot more Shadow Pokémon appearing lately. Could Team GO Rocket be using the same technology again?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_4_6
TEXT: And is this connected to what they stole from behind the mysterious door? What if it was some sort of power that they’ve now amplified and corrupted...?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_4_7
TEXT: And with Celebi about and its time travel powers— Egad! Who knows what Team GO Rocket could do! There’s no time to waste. Let’s save Gyarados and then set our sights on finding Celebi before it’s too late!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_5_0
TEXT: Great work, %PLAYERNAME%! That Gyarados is much calmer now that you’ve rescued it from Team GO Rocket.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_5_1
TEXT: It looks like Team GO Rocket’s retreating as well, so how about we continue with our festivities? They’ve stolen enough of our time.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_5_2_totodile

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_5_3
TEXT: Even in the direst of situations, when you’re pulled from all sides, it’s essential to take time to decompress and enjoy a peaceful moment with your friends.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_5_4
TEXT: Times like that give us the strength to persevere.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_5_5_chikorita

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_5_5_cyndaquil

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_6_3
TEXT: Enough of my chatter—why don’t you go make some new friends yourself? There’s plenty of day left to enjoy.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_7_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, sorry to rush you, but we have to hurry! There’s been a confirmed Celebi sighting just moments ago. If you go now, you might be able to catch it!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_7_1
TEXT: Let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_8_0

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_8_1

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_8_2
TEXT: After all the trouble we’ve had with Team GO Rocket, I welcome the reminder that peaceful times aren’t too far off.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_8_3
TEXT: While you were out, I uncovered the truth Team GO Rocket has been trying so hard to hide: they’ve captured Lugia and Ho-Oh.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_8_4
TEXT: It gets worse: using the power they stole from behind the mysterious door in conjunction with radio technology developed via their past broadcasts, they’ve forced Lugia and Ho-Oh to ascend to a level of power beyond any Shadow Pokémon we’ve ever seen.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_8_5
TEXT: They’re calling them Apex Shadow Lugia and Apex Shadow Ho-Oh. Get ready, %PLAYERNAME%—the battle’s only just begun.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotoursik_dialogue_0_0
TEXT: Well hello, %PLAYERNAME%! How’d you enjoy yesterday’s festivities? I hope you’re still feeling energetic, because there’s more in store—and this time, we’re focusing on the Kanto region!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotoursik_dialogue_0_1
TEXT: What better place to start one’s Pokémon adventure, no?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotoursik_dialogue_0_2
TEXT: Now, let’s get out there and start exploring!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotoursik_dialogue_1_0
TEXT: Ah, %PLAYERNAME%, you’re looking a bit tired. Why not take a quick break? Play with your buddy a bit, maybe feed it a nice juicy Berry?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotoursik_dialogue_1_1
TEXT: While you’re at it, why not grab a snack yourself! Even the strongest Trainers can’t run on an empty stomach.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotoursik_dialogue_2_0
TEXT: Having fun, %PLAYERNAME%? Are you all warmed up for your next adventure? I hope so, because you’ll soon be exploring the area’s different habitats.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotoursik_dialogue_2_1
TEXT: There are five habitats, each filled with unique Pokémon. Which habitats have which Pokémon, you ask? Well, let’s go find out!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotoursik_dialogue_3_0
TEXT: Nice snapshots, %PLAYERNAME%! You really captured the essence of the Pokémon, and it looks like the little models were having a good time, too.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotoursik_dialogue_3_1
TEXT: Did you enjoy your excursion through the habitats? I bet you encountered an immense amount of Pokémon, both familiar and new to you!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotoursik_dialogue_3_2
TEXT: There are tons of amazing Trainers out here exploring as well.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotoursik_dialogue_3_3
TEXT: Why not make a few new friends, then trade or battle with them?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotoursik_dialogue_4_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! While you were out, I heard that a powerful Legendary Pokémon has been sighted in the area.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotoursik_dialogue_4_1

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotoursik_dialogue_5_1
