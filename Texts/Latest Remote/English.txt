RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_finale_1_1_1
TEXT: Pokémon Trainer! I have a positive update to share.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_finale_1_1_2
TEXT: After analyzing the data we collected from the Ultra Wormholes, I have located—and retrieved—Professor Willow from Ultra Space.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_finale_1_1_3
TEXT: His return would not have been possible without your exhaustive efforts.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_finale_1_1_4
TEXT: I do not doubt you are eager to speak with him, but he requires rest before your reunion.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_finale_1_1_5
TEXT: Following that, I would appreciate your assistance with another matter.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_finale_1_1_6
TEXT: UB-01 Symbiont and UB-02 Beauty—that is, Nihilego and Pheromosa—have once again returned to this world.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_finale_1_1_7
TEXT: I need not emphasize what dangers they pose.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_finale_1_1_8
TEXT: Additionally, new signals indicate that other Ultra Beasts may soon follow.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_finale_1_1_9
TEXT: But first, your professor. You and I can reconvene after you two have spoken.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_finale_1_2_1
TEXT: ... ... ...
%PLAYERNAME%? Is...that you?
How long has it been? It’s good to see you. I’ve had the most amazing adventure!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_finale_1_2_2
TEXT: There I was, pondering the mysteries of the island guardians—and moping a little at my misfortune, I must admit—when a glowing portal appeared out of thin air!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_finale_1_2_3
TEXT: I couldn’t help wondering what was on the other side. My curiosity ignited, I weighed the risks, grabbed my gear, and jumped right in!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_finale_1_2_4
TEXT: The portal led to a completely different dimension—one traversed by unimaginably strange creatures...

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_finale_1_2_5
TEXT: I must tell you all about it! *yawn* But before I do, I could use a little nap. I promise I’ll spare no detail after I’ve slept...a few...
*snore*

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_finale_2_1_1
TEXT: Welcome back, Pokémon Trainer. I hope you had a pleasant reunion with your professor. Has he fallen asleep? Understandable.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_finale_2_1_2
TEXT: You and I can turn our attention to the Ultra Beasts while he recuperates.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_finale_2_1_3
TEXT: I have confirmed the reappearance of UB-02 Absorption, Buzzwole.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_finale_2_1_4
TEXT: Buzzwole’s propensity for displaying its robust musculature remains a mystery—is it mere self-satisfaction or some kind of threat?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_finale_2_1_5
TEXT: Its sturdy physique stands in contrast to Pheromosa’s lithe frame.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_finale_2_1_6
TEXT: Though neither should be underestimated.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_finale_2_1_7
TEXT: Since we cannot predict their behavior, I propose further observation. Have you all your necessary supplies?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_finale_2_1_8

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_sapporo_city_team_leader_desc_2

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_sapporo_city_team_leader_desc_3
TEXT: As for how, I cannot say... But I trust that person’s expertise on the matter.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_sapporo_city_ub_1
TEXT: My data indicates that the Ultra Beast most likely to appear is UB-03 Lighting.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_sapporo_city_ub_2
TEXT: Some humans call it Xurkitree. They stand unmoving with their limbs stuck into the ground.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_sapporo_city_ub_3
TEXT: It must not be allowed to wreak havoc.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_sapporo_city_ub_4
TEXT: Be warned that this Ultra Beast is not easily subdued.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_sapporo_city_ub_5
TEXT: That is why I have prepared some Beast Balls for you.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_sapporo_city_wrap_up_1

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_sapporo_city_wrap_up_2

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_sapporo_park_pokemon
TEXT: I have seen—let me consult my notes—Galarian Ponyta, Lapras, Makuhita, and Litwick...

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_1_1
TEXT: Good night, Pokémon Trainer. No—is it good morning now?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_1_10
TEXT: Others have also expressed distress over his absence.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_1_11
TEXT: Specifically, a man with spiked hair and an apparent affection for the color yellow.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_1_12
TEXT: He has been conducting reconnaissance and seeking clues to your professor’s whereabouts by speaking to Pokémon Trainers assembled at raids.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_1_13
TEXT: Perhaps we can also venture to Gyms as we attempt to locate the Ultra Wormhole. Those gathered may help direct our search.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_1_14
TEXT: Let us go, Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_1_2
TEXT: Temporal expressions aside, I am struck by our surroundings.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_1_3
TEXT: This is quite a bustling place.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_1_4
TEXT: Which makes my recent readings all the more distressing. I have detected signals that indicate the inevitable appearance of an Ultra Wormhole.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_1_5
TEXT: We must locate it and prepare for the emergence of another Ultra Beast.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_1_6
TEXT: Let us survey the city.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_1_7
TEXT: I have also not forgotten about your missing professor.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_2_1
TEXT: How brightly glass glistens when touched by the sun...

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_2_2
TEXT: Apologies. Even the mundane becomes novel in this abundant light.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_2_3
TEXT: But I digress. Have you seen any additional anomalies on your patrol?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_2_4
TEXT: In an area this large, I cannot pinpoint the exact location from which an Ultra Wormhole will originate.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_2_5
TEXT: We can only rely on our own visual surveillance.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_2_6
TEXT: I wonder if the items provided by your PokéStops might help us prepare for the Ultra Wormhole’s impending arrival.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_2_7
TEXT: It would befit us to gather as much aid as possible.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_3_1
TEXT: Pokémon Trainer. Indulge me in a moment of introspection.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_3_2
TEXT: To me, the humans here are exceedingly fortunate.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_3_3
TEXT: Even with all our technology, my home is not at all like this.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_3_4
TEXT: A world of darkness...

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_3_5
TEXT: Yet here, light spills from the smallest things—such as your Incubators and their Eggs.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_3_6
TEXT: If you can forgive another imposition, will you show me the effect of an Incubator once again?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_3_7
TEXT: I wish to see its light.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_3_8
TEXT: Thank you, Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_4_1
TEXT: Pokémon Trainer. I have located the Ultra Wormhole.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_4_10
TEXT:  I hope they prove useful.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_4_2
TEXT: The appearance of an Ultra Beast is imminent.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_4_3
TEXT: Fortunately, you and I have a history of contending with such situations.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_4_4
TEXT: My data indicates that the Ultra Beast most likely to appear is UB-02 Absorption.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_4_5
TEXT: Some humans call it Buzzwole. It seems to enjoy displaying its robust musculature.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_4_6
TEXT: It must not be allowed to wreak havoc.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_4_7
TEXT: Be warned that this Ultra Beast is not easily subdued.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_4_8
TEXT: That is why I have prepared some Beast Balls for you.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_4_9
TEXT: They are a type of ball specifically designed to capture Ultra Beasts.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_5_1
TEXT: You impress me yet again, Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_5_10
TEXT: Until that time, I release you to your festivities. The light of your celebration beckons.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_5_11
TEXT: Until again, Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_5_2
TEXT: The ease with which you handled Buzzwole is enviable. It is a technique unfamiliar to me, and yet it comes to you naturally.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_5_3
TEXT: Now, I have an update to share.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_5_4
TEXT: I detected an odd signal when Buzzwole emerged from the Ultra Wormhole.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_5_6
TEXT: Using it, I can better investigate where within Ultra Space your Professor Willow may be.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_5_7
TEXT: I will continue to do what I can to expedite his recovery.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_1_1
TEXT: Pokémon Trainer. Good...morning? Or is it the evening?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_1_10
TEXT: Perhaps we should both patrol the area to familiarize ourselves with its geography and identify any emerging irregularities.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_1_11
TEXT: Come, Pokémon Trainer. Let us begin.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_1_2
TEXT: I am still growing accustomed to the cycles of this world.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_1_3
TEXT: But enough about time—let us focus on space. Prior to your arrival, I was surveying the area for Ultra Wormholes.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_1_4
TEXT: Though I find myself getting lost in the atmosphere around us.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_1_5
TEXT: Trainers are gathering here en masse...

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_1_6
TEXT: Ah. So it’s a festival to celebrate the Pokémon Trainers of this world.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_1_7
TEXT: And since you are present, I assume you mean to participate.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_1_8
TEXT: Do enjoy, then. But I would caution you to stay alert.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_1_9
TEXT: If an Ultra Beast were to appear amid such a gathering, chaos would ensue.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_2_1
TEXT: It is beautiful here. Dazzlingly so...

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_2_2
TEXT: Ah. You have once again caught me in a moment of reverie, Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_2_3
TEXT: I am continually struck by the radiance of this world.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_2_4
TEXT: Back home—it is dark.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_2_5
TEXT: You and your fellows are fortunate.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_2_6
TEXT: ... ... ...

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_2_7
TEXT: We should continue our patrol. After you, Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_3_1
TEXT: This place has drawn a remarkable number of Pokémon—an astounding example of regional biodiversity.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_3_2
TEXT: One even attempted to approach me. Your world’s Pokémon offer friendship so effortlessly. If only the Ultra Beasts were as amiable.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_3_3
TEXT: I have seen—let me consult my notes—Lapras, Skorupi, Litwick, Rufflet...

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_3_4
TEXT: Even my idle time has been illuminating. I discovered that Litwick shines a light that absorbs the life energy of people and Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_3_5
TEXT: I noted this phenomenon from a distance.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_3_6
TEXT: Another benefit of your photographic observations. What else can be safely documented through them?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_3_7
TEXT: Taking snapshots of the unique locations in this area might answer this. It is “worth a shoot,” at any rate.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_4_1
TEXT: Pokémon Trainer, you mentioned that you and Willow were pursuing the Pokémon Shaymin before his disappearance, correct?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_4_2
TEXT: I recently overheard another Pokémon Trainer say that “upon taking in the scent of a particular rare flower, Shaymin is enveloped in light, and its tiny body transforms.”

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_4_3
TEXT: An irradiant image.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_4_4
TEXT: I wonder if this transformation is akin to Evolution or if it is something else entirely.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_4_5
TEXT: There is so much I do not know about Pokémon, and yet you gift your knowledge to me freely.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_4_6
TEXT: Our time together has taught me much, and for that, I—

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_4_7
TEXT: Wait. An anomaly is approaching. It almost resembles the description you gave of the Pokémon Shaymin, and yet with marked differences...

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_5_1
TEXT: So, I have seen Shaymin and its transformative light.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_5_2
TEXT: And from within this light emerges another form.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_5_3
TEXT: What a resplendent revelation.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_5_6
TEXT: You said Shaymin is drawn to gratitude. Do you believe it was my own such feelings that brought it here?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_5_7
TEXT: I am pleased that it recognizes my appreciation.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_5_8
TEXT: And I hope that appreciation is apparent to you as well.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_5_9
TEXT: With no proximate threat, you should return to your festival. I will keep watch.

RESOURCE ID: gofest_2022_finale_2_2_1
TEXT: A brilliant display, Pokémon Trainer. Before we continue, I have something for you.

RESOURCE ID: gofest_2022_finale_2_2_2
TEXT: Here—a small supply of Beast Balls.

RESOURCE ID: gofest_2022_finale_2_2_3
TEXT: Excuse me if I am repeating myself, but allow me a brief explanation.

RESOURCE ID: gofest_2022_finale_2_2_4
TEXT: Beast Balls were developed specifically to capture Ultra Beasts. Your assistance enabled me to fabricate them—I wish to help you as you have helped me.

RESOURCE ID: gofest_2022_finale_2_2_5
TEXT: I trust you will know the right time to use them. Now, let us continue our work.

RESOURCE ID: gofest_2022_finale_3_1_1
TEXT: Pokémon Trainer—I feel we are being watched. Could it be Team GO Rocket?

RESOURCE ID: gofest_2022_finale_3_1_2
TEXT: If they have been observing us, then do you believe they have plans that involve the Ultra Beasts?

RESOURCE ID: gofest_2022_finale_3_1_3
TEXT: This is a possibility we cannot ignore.

RESOURCE ID: gofest_2022_finale_3_1_4
TEXT: If only I could battle like you do... Until then, I must ask again for your aid.

RESOURCE ID: gofest_2022_finale_3_2_1
TEXT: Thank you for dispersing Team GO Rocket, Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: gofest_2022_finale_3_2_2
TEXT: I am relieved to know that they have been removed from the equation.

RESOURCE ID: gofest_2022_finale_3_2_3
TEXT: Your strength is further appreciated given this world’s most recent arrival—UB-03 Lighting. Xurkitree.

RESOURCE ID: gofest_2022_finale_3_2_4
TEXT: It has been known to raid power plants, presumably to energize itself with electricity.

RESOURCE ID: gofest_2022_finale_3_2_5
TEXT: It would be disastrous if Xurkitree depleted the power in this area.

RESOURCE ID: gofest_2022_finale_3_2_6
TEXT: Let us do what we can to prevent this catastrophe.

RESOURCE ID: gofest_2022_finale_4_1_1
TEXT: *yawn*
Oh, %PLAYERNAME%. Sorry I dozed off on you there—I hardly slept while I was away. Did anything interesting happen while I was gone?

RESOURCE ID: gofest_2022_finale_4_1_10
TEXT: You and your Pokémon should go check it out. I’ll be here. Just give me a...minute...
*snore*

RESOURCE ID: gofest_2022_finale_4_1_2
TEXT: ... ... ...
Ultra Wormholes?
Ultra Beasts?
BEAST BALLS?!

RESOURCE ID: gofest_2022_finale_4_1_3
TEXT: Incredible! I can always count on you to unearth amazing things. You even helped bring me home!

RESOURCE ID: gofest_2022_finale_4_1_4
TEXT: In that space, there were times when my memories would blur together—but I swear I could feel the light of our world, and everything would rush back.

RESOURCE ID: gofest_2022_finale_4_1_5
TEXT: No, it was more than a feeling. It was like I was surrounded by a protective presence—warm like the sun and calm like the moon.

RESOURCE ID: gofest_2022_finale_4_1_6
TEXT: Even so, I don’t know how I would have returned if you and your new friend hadn’t intervened.

RESOURCE ID: gofest_2022_finale_4_1_7
TEXT: I’m always thankful for you, but this time, you really saved me.

RESOURCE ID: gofest_2022_finale_4_1_8
TEXT: Why, I could just hug you, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: gofest_2022_finale_4_1_9
TEXT: Wait. Is there something in the sky? I’d investigate myself, but... *yawn* I suddenly feel like I lost a staring contest with a Hypno.

RESOURCE ID: gofest_2022_finale_4_2_1
TEXT: Pokémon Trainer, I saw you were able to speak with the professor. Is he in good health?

RESOURCE ID: gofest_2022_finale_4_2_2
TEXT: He felt something akin to light of the sun and moon, did he?

RESOURCE ID: gofest_2022_finale_4_2_3
TEXT: Interesting.

RESOURCE ID: gofest_2022_finale_4_2_4
TEXT: The important thing is that you and your Willow have been reunited. Endless musing is my proclivity, not yours.

RESOURCE ID: gofest_2022_finale_4_2_5
TEXT: Before we redirect our attention to the Ultra Beasts, I wish to take this opportunity to express what an excellent...erm...

RESOURCE ID: gofest_2022_finale_4_2_6
TEXT: I had intended to call you my “research partner,” but that feels insufficient. You are more than an assistant—you are my confidant.

RESOURCE ID: gofest_2022_finale_4_2_7
TEXT: Such a sterile title hardly suits a person as dazzling as you.

RESOURCE ID: gofest_2022_finale_4_2_8
TEXT: So thank you, %PLAYERNAME%.
My partner...and my friend.

TEXT: The notes were indeed enlightening, Pokémon Trainer. Your professor calls this device “Daily Adventure Incense.”

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_dai_part2_0_1
TEXT: Upon activation, it will attract Pokémon to your location for 15 minutes—so long as you are moving.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_dai_part2_0_2
TEXT: The professor has arranged that one be made available to you each day. His writings indicate a sincere hope that this invention will facilitate new friendships and adventures.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_dai_part2_0_3
TEXT: What rare components must this device contain?

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_dai_part2_0_4
TEXT: ... ... ...

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_dai_part2_0_5
TEXT: Let us activate it and see what happens.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_dai_part2_1_0
TEXT: Thank you for the demonstration, Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_dai_part2_1_1
TEXT: I see potential in this device.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_dai_part2_1_2
TEXT: It appears to attract a slightly different variety of Pokémon than what one would expect to encounter.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_dai_part2_1_3
TEXT: How clever.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_dai_part2_1_4
TEXT: The professor’s creativity and thoughtfulness is admirable.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_dai_part2_1_5
TEXT: I eagerly anticipate the day I meet him. The tools of this world are fascinating, but the people...even more so.

TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I just developed this new type of Incense—Daily Adventure Incense.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dailyincense_0_1
TEXT: One Daily Adventure Incense lasts for 15 minutes and stays active only while you’re moving. Most importantly, though, this Incense can attract almost any Pokémon you’ve encountered before—even Legendary Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dailyincense_0_2
TEXT: I’ll give you one Daily Adventure Incense each day, so don’t be afraid to go out on some adventures! In fact, why not start one now? Try to catch as many Pokémon as you can!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_0_0
TEXT: What peculiar coloring. Is it an aberration, or—?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_0_1
TEXT: Ah. You have arrived at an opportune moment, Pokémon Trainer. Might I seek your insight?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_0_2
TEXT: Zigzagoon are present in vast numbers today, but they are notably different from those I have observed previously.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_0_3
TEXT: Zigzagoon’s fur is normally earthy in hue, but these Zigzagoon are black and white.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_0_4
TEXT: Can you explain this?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_0_5
TEXT: I see... These Zigzagoon were first discovered in the Galar region.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_0_6
TEXT: So a single Pokémon species can develop differently based on its habitat? Fascinating.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_0_7
TEXT: I will spend today observing these Galarian Zigzagoon. Will you assist me, Pokémon Trainer?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_1_0
TEXT: How energetic these Galarian Zigzagoon are. Have you also observed how they dash in a zigzag pattern?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_1_1
TEXT: I hypothesized that this may increase its evasiveness—but when I tested it myself, I grew quite dizzy.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_1_2
TEXT: Fret not, Pokémon Trainer—no people or Pokémon were harmed during my experiment.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_1_3
TEXT: I am left wondering whether evolution would ease or encourage Galarian Zigzagoon’s frenetic movements. Perhaps we can discover that answer together.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_2_0
TEXT: Thank you for your assistance, Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_2_1
TEXT: I have concluded that Galarian Linoone’s disposition is no calmer than Galarian Zigzagoon’s. Indeed, its aggression appears to have increased.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_2_2
TEXT: Not long before your arrival, I observed a group of Galarian Linoone using their long tongues to taunt other Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_2_3
TEXT: They then hurled themselves at their enraged foes.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_2_4
TEXT: I am continuously enthralled by the ways Pokémon interact with each other.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_2_5
TEXT: Might Galarian Linoone itself be capable of evolution? More research is required.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_3_0
TEXT: Greetings, Pokémon Trainer. You have brought me...Obstagoon, is it?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_3_1
TEXT: Unlike Galarian Linoone, Obstagoon stands on two legs. I surmise this is to establish a threatening posture.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_3_2
TEXT: What’s more, I witnessed firsthand its ability to make staggering vocal outbursts.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_3_3
TEXT: My heart has yet to return to its normal rhythm.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_3_4
TEXT: I find it remarkable that the assertive Obstagoon was once a diminutive Galarian Zigzagoon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_3_5
TEXT: How must it feel to experience such profound transformation? I assume your Professor Willow would have some insight.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_3_6
TEXT: This has been a valuable learning experience. Thank you for your assistance today, Pokémon Trainer.
