RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%. How’s your day?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_0_1
TEXT: Personally, mine is going swimmingly. Or perhaps…flappingly? You see, an enormous flock of Fletchling has gathered nearby.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_0_2
TEXT: I heard some Pokémon chirping up a storm, so I went to investigate and found Fletchling as far as the eye can see!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_0_3
TEXT: Fletchling is known as the Tiny Robin Pokémon, and it’s typically quite amiable and easy to train. Send it into battle, though, and you’ll quickly see its more ferocious side!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_0_4
TEXT: A fascinating little Pokémon. But as glad as I am to see it here, it’s quite odd for so many to gather in one place.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_0_5
TEXT: Would you mind conducting some research so we can better understand what’s going on?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_1_0
TEXT: Great work, Trainer. Looks like you’ve got your very own Fletchling to join you on your journey!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_1_1
TEXT: Did you know that Fletchling’s body is always warm? In fact, Trainers who live in cold areas apparently sleep with this Pokémon in their beds. How about that?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_1_2
TEXT: I’m always fascinated to learn about how Pokémon and their Trainers work and live together. And it never hurts to know how to cope on cold nights, eh?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_1_3
TEXT: Anyway, Fletchling evolves into the Fire- and Flying-type Pokémon Fletchinder.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_1_4
TEXT: Known as the Ember Pokémon, Fletchinder is exceedingly territorial and aggressive.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_1_5
TEXT: It’s also incredibly fast. Its speed from takeoff puts it easily among the fastest of all bird Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_1_6
TEXT: When you’re ready, why don’t you try evolving your Fletchling into Fletchinder? I’d love to witness that famous speed firsthand!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_2_0
TEXT: That’s a mighty fine Fletchinder you have there, %PLAYERNAME%. Congratulations!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_2_1
TEXT: Naturally, I’ve been busy as well. In fact, I have some information you may find useful as you train Fletchinder.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_2_2
TEXT: You see, Fletchinder is known to expel embers from its beak to set grass on fire. Then, it pounces on the bewildered prey that flee the flames.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_2_3
TEXT: Pretty intense, huh? Best not to wing it during training, if you catch my draft—er, drift.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_2_4
TEXT: Try not to let any fires Fletchinder starts get out of hand, too. We’re all responsible for caring for our environment, after all!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_2_5
TEXT: With that said, there are still a few more tasks I’d like you to complete in aid of our research.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_2_6
TEXT: Chief among those is to obtain a Talonflame, the evolution of Fletchinder. They’re said to have simply magnificent wings! Do you think you could evolve your Fletchinder, Trainer?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_3_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%—and hello, Talonflame!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_3_1
TEXT: I know I’ve put you through your paces today, but it’s all paid off in the end! You’re now the proud Trainer of Talonflame, the Scorching Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_3_2
TEXT: Talonflame is known to shower embers from the gaps between its feathers during the heat of battle. It then takes to the air, reaching speeds of up to 310 mph.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_3_3
TEXT: Remember how I mentioned Talonflame’s wings before? Fire can’t pass through them, so they were used to outfit firefighters way back when.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_3_4
TEXT: Amazing stuff! I’m always impressed by this brave bird. The two of you will no doubt accomplish great things—and at great speeds!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_3_5
TEXT: Thanks for your help today, Trainer. I hope you had as much fun as I did!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_3_6
TEXT: Now, let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_4_1_alt
TEXT: I managed to build another Super Rocket Radar to help you track down Giovanni. But be careful—Blanche and Candela’s reports revealed that Giovanni has got a Legendary Shadow Pokémon with him!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_4_2_alt
TEXT: You need to save it, Trainer! I have no doubt Giovanni plans on using this poor Pokémon to nefarious ends.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_5_1_alt
TEXT: Not only did you stop Team GO Rocket, but you also saved several Pokémon along the way!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq8_0_0
TEXT: Good to see you, %PLAYERNAME%. I’m sorry to call you here so suddenly, but I’m afraid there’s trouble afoot.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq8_0_1
TEXT: That’s right—Team GO Rocket is up to no good! We’re not sure what their plan is just yet, but we know we have to stop them.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq8_0_2
TEXT: Now, let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq8_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%. You did a tremendous job defeating those Team GO Rocket Grunts and saving those poor Shadow Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq8_1_1
TEXT: While you were busy battling, I received reports that Team GO Rocket has obtained a Flying-type Legendary Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq8_1_2
TEXT: Blanche is doing recon as we speak in hopes of figuring out exactly which Legendary Pokémon we’re dealing with. I have no doubt we’ll have more information soon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq8_1_3
TEXT: While we wait, why don’t you conduct some research on Flying-type Pokémon?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq8_2_0
TEXT: Thanks for catching all those Flying-type Pokémon, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq8_2_1
TEXT: Blanche and I have been analyzing them to help us learn more about the Legendary Pokémon that Team GO Rocket captured.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq8_2_2
TEXT: Unfortunately, our current hypothesis points to this Pokémon being one that’s near and dear to the team leaders’ hearts.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq8_2_3
TEXT: While we gather more information, could you head back out into the field? We can’t let Team GO Rocket continue its plan unopposed!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq8_3_0
TEXT: Welcome back, Trainer. I see you’ve got yourself a Pidgeot and some Pidgeot Mega Energy!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq8_3_1
TEXT: As impressive as this Pokémon is, though, it doesn’t seem to be the Flying-type Pokémon we've heard about in our reports.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq8_3_2
TEXT: Blanche’s latest intel points to Giovanni being the one holding on to this mysterious Flying-type Legendary Pokémon, so we need to track him down.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq8_3_3
TEXT: We believe our best bet at doing so is by first finding the Team GO Rocket Leaders—and that’s where you come in, Trainer. Let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq8_4_0
TEXT: Great work, %PLAYERNAME%! You’ve been a huge help in our efforts to track down Giovanni. I’m happy to report that the team leaders and I have made significant headway in our investigation.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq8_4_1
TEXT: I’ve managed to finish building another Super Rocket Radar for you. You can use it to find and defeat Giovanni—and save that Legendary Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq8_5_0
TEXT: Fantastic work as always, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq8_5_1
TEXT: The fight against Team GO Rocket and their malicious machinations continues, but at least for today we can rest knowing that we’ve foiled their latest scheme.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq8_5_2
TEXT: So, until next time—let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! It’s good to see you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_0_1
TEXT: As you know, I’ve recently been conducting research on several different regions in the world of Pokémon. Along the way, I came across some books that collected stories and legends from various regions.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_0_2
TEXT: One of these tomes told of three Legendary Pokémon from the Unova region—a trio that seem to be capable of changing formes.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_0_3
TEXT: Needless to say, that piqued my interest, and I became so enveloped in my research that I even began seeing those three Legendary Pokémon in my dreams!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_0_4
TEXT: Which brings me to why I called you here. Can you help me with some research, Trainer? I was thinking we could start by catching some Rock-type Pokémon—you know, just to give ourselves a sturdy foundation to build from.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_0_5
TEXT: ...Get it? Sturdy? Because they’re...Rock-type? A-anyway, I’d appreciate the help. Let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, Trainer. Now that we’ve established a foundation for our research, we need to narrow our focus.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_1_1
TEXT: There are three stories I want to investigate, so I think the best approach is to focus on one story at a time and see what we can learn.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_1_2
TEXT: My hope is to discover as much as we can about these Pokémon, so that when we see clues or signs of their appearance, we’re as prepared as possible!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_1_3
TEXT: This first story tells of a Legendary Pokémon called Landorus. The story says that lands visited by Landorus yield such bountiful crops that it’s been hailed as “The Guardian of the Fields.”

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_1_4
TEXT: Landorus seems to have two formes: Incarnate Forme, and the very rarely seen Therian Forme. I haven’t been able to find any imagery depicting the latter, but every source I’ve read agrees on its existence!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_1_5
TEXT: For now, why don’t we research Ground-type Pokémon? Maybe in doing so we can better equip ourselves to identify Landorus’s Therian Forme when the time comes.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_2_0
TEXT: Thank you, %PLAYERNAME%. I think we’ve gained a better understanding of Landorus after studying Ground-type Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_2_1
TEXT: And is that a Drilbur you’ve got there? I dig it! ...Haha! Sorry, sorry.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_2_2
TEXT: Anyway, since we’ve explored all our leads on Landorus for the moment, what do you say we move on to another Pokémon from my dream?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_2_3
TEXT: Let’s focus on Tornadus next. The texts say Tornadus expels massive energy from its tail, causing severe storms, and that its power is great enough to blow houses away.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_2_4
TEXT: Like Landorus, Tornadus also has both Incarnate and Therian Formes. Hmm... Maybe researching Flying-type Pokémon in the area is our best bet for now? Let’s give it a shot, Trainer!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_3_0
TEXT: Excellent work, Trainer! Thanks for documenting that information about Tornadus. It seems you even found yourself a darling Ducklett along the way! Is it all it’s quacked up to be? Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_3_1
TEXT: I think we’ve learned everything we can about Tornadus for now. Its Therian Forme is still a mystery, but hopefully not for long!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_3_2
TEXT: Before we start investigating the final Legendary Pokémon from my dream, I need to share something...strange.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_3_3
TEXT: You see, I’d been running myself a bit ragged with research, so I stopped for an afternoon nap. In the resulting dream, I saw those three Unovan Legendary Pokémon again, clear as crystal. But then, the whole dream just started...fading.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_3_4
TEXT: It was almost like something was eating the dream itself. I’m still not sure what to make of it all, but let's stay on the lookout for anything suspicious. I have a hunch this may be the work of a Pokémon nearby.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_3_5
TEXT: For now, though, let’s continue our research and turn our attention to the last of the three Unovan Legendary Pokémon detailed in those stories—Thundurus.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_3_6
TEXT: Thundurus is known as the Bolt Strike Pokémon, and its story also references both Incarnate and Therian Formes. The spikes on its tail are said to discharge immense bolts of lightning.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_3_7
TEXT: For the sake of consistency, let’s go ahead and research Electric-type Pokémon in the area as we compile our notes on Thundurus.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_4_0
TEXT: Ah, there you are, %PLAYERNAME%. I have something big to share!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_4_1
TEXT: But first, I want to thank you for all your hard work collecting information on Landorus, Tornadus, and Thundurus.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_4_2
TEXT: I feel confident that when the time comes, you’ll be prepared to encounter any of these amazing Legendary Pokémon—regardless of which forme they appear in.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_4_3
TEXT: Now—do you remember that strange experience I had where my dream began fading inexplicably? I think I may have finally uncovered the cause.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_4_4
TEXT: While consulting the Pokédex for possible culprits, I came across an entry for a Pokémon called Munna. It’s known as the Dream Eater Pokémon—so you can see why it caught my eye!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_4_5
TEXT: Munna is said to eat the dreams of both people and Pokémon, expelling mist as a result. The mist is pink if the dream is pleasant, and black if it’s a nightmare.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_4_6
TEXT: I was pretty pleased to be dreaming of those Unovan Legendary Pokémon again, so I suspect Munna’s mist was nice and rosy that day! 

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_4_7
TEXT: Munna seems like a fascinating Pokémon, and I can’t wait to research it more. I hope you’ll give me a hand when the time comes, Trainer! Now, let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! Perfect timing.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_0_1
TEXT: I just got back from a lengthy stroll in the sunshine. It’s incredible how much a bit of fresh air can affect your energy and mood!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_0_2
TEXT: But that’s not the only thing that’s got me feeling chipper. You see, I witnessed something quite interesting while I was out and about.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_0_3
TEXT: Perhaps in response to the abundant sunlight, a congregation of Snivy appears to have formed nearby.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_0_4
TEXT: I don’t know about you, but this seems to me like a golden opportunity to research the Grass Snake Pokémon. Could you lend me a hand?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_0_5
TEXT: They’re known to be fairly calm, so you shouldn’t have much trouble observing them.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_0_6
TEXT: Good luck out there!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, Trainer! Great work.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_1_1
TEXT: I have some information for you on why Snivy are so fond of the sun.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_1_2
TEXT: These Grass-type Pokémon photosynthesize by bathing their tails in sunlight. Much like the sunshine they crave, Snivy are quite bright!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_1_3
TEXT: They were first encountered in the Unova region, where they were known for their intelligence and calm demeanor. Fascinating!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_1_4
TEXT: While we continue researching their sudden appearance, could you evolve a Snivy for me? I’d like to document its Evolution, Servine.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_1_5
TEXT: Take care when you do, however—Servine is known for its masterful whipping techniques.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_2_0
TEXT: Wonderful work, %PLAYERNAME%! That’s a mighty fine Servine.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_2_1
TEXT: Like Snivy, Servine is known as the Grass Snake Pokémon. It moves along the ground as if sliding. Though it’s far from sluggish, it won’t hesitate to seek out the shadows of thick foliage to avoid attacks.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_2_2
TEXT: Now that we’ve properly documented Snivy and Servine, I’d like to move on to Serperior, Snivy’s final Evolution.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_2_3
TEXT: Serperior is known as the Regal Pokémon, and much like Snivy and Servine, it also has a penchant for sunlight. It takes in solar energy and boosts it internally.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_2_4
TEXT: Could you evolve your Servine into Serperior for me, Trainer? It’ll be a great boon to my research, and you’ll have a powerful Grass-type Pokémon to join your journey as well!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_3_0
TEXT: Fantastic work, Trainer! I have no doubt Serperior will prove a potent asset on your adventures.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_3_1
TEXT: It has an incredible ability to stop its opponents’ movements with a single glare. Should the opponent prove bold enough to continue, Serperior will give its all in battle.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_3_2
TEXT: Having a Pokémon like that by your side would be pretty inspiring, I’d say!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_3_3
TEXT: Anyway, thanks again for all your help in this sun-soaked endeavor. I think I’ll take one more walk before the day’s done—can’t let weather like this go to waste!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_3_4
