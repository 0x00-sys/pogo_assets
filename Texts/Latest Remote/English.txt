RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_0_0
TEXT: Hello there, %PLAYERNAME%! Look around—have you ever seen so many Bulbasaur?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_0_1
TEXT: Personally, I’ve only witnessed a gathering like this once before. It was some time ago, and there were so many Trainers out and about catching all the little Seed Pokémon they could find.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_0_2
TEXT: In fact, seeing all these Bulbasaur has me feeling quite nostalgic!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_0_3
TEXT: It also reminded me of an important scientific tenet: there’s always more to learn! And I never tire of researching Pokémon, no matter the species.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_0_4
TEXT: In that spirit, what do you say we do some research on Bulbasaur, Trainer?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, Trainer. That’s a downright adorable Bulbasaur you’ve caught!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_1_1
TEXT: Did you know that Bulbasaur uses the nutrients that are stored in the seed on its back to grow?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_1_2
TEXT: I’d love to have a built-in snack backpack. It would keep my stomach quiet in the field, that’s for sure! Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_1_3
TEXT: As you may know, Bulbasaur’s Evolution—Ivysaur—gains strength when it’s exposed to sunlight.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_1_4
TEXT: That sunlight also makes the bud on its back grow larger. It would be lovely to witness that phenomenon myself, for old time’s sake.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_1_5
TEXT: While you go off and evolve your Bulbasaur, I’ll continue following this pack of Bulbasaur I’ve been observing. They appear to be on the move!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_2_0
TEXT: Goodness me, look at the size of that Ivysaur! Well done, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_2_1
TEXT: If memory serves, the bud on Ivysaur’s back produces a sweet aroma when it starts to swell, indicating the flower’s about to bloom.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_2_2
TEXT: Have you gotten a whiff of that scent yet? If you do, your Ivysaur may be getting ready to evolve!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_2_3
TEXT: Now, remember that pack of Bulbasaur I was following? A handful of Ivysaur have recently emerged from a nearby forest to join them.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_2_4
TEXT: They all seem to be heading in the same direction... But what’s their destination, I wonder? Let’s go see if we can’t dig up some answers, hm?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_3_0
TEXT: Welcome back %PLAYERNAME%. Hold on—is that a Venusaur with you?! It must be my lucky day.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_3_1
TEXT: You see, the Bulbasaur and Ivysaur I was following led me to a grove where a Venusaur was resting. There was an unusual scent in the air that seemed to calm the Pokémon that had gathered.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_3_2
TEXT: I’ve read that Venusaur sometimes produces a scent that attracts other Pokémon, so I surmised that’s what was occurring.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_3_3
TEXT: In fact, the way the Bulbasaur and Ivysaur gathered around Venusaur reminded me of how Lure Modules work to attract Pokémon via scent.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_3_4
TEXT: Now, let’s talk Venusaur. Did you know it can Mega Evolve?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_3_5
TEXT: Take this Venusaur Mega Energy and try Mega Evolving your new friend. You’ll learn more by experiencing Mega Venusaur’s power for yourself!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_3_6
TEXT: There are so many things we can learn from Pokémon, and researching them can lead us to even more exciting discoveries. I hope you enjoyed yourself during today’s scientific excursion!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2021_0_0
TEXT: Hello there, %PLAYERNAME%! We’ve come to the end of the year once again...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2021_0_1
TEXT: And it looks like some familiar Pokémon from earlier this year are reappearing, too!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2021_0_2
TEXT: Do you think they’re here to celebrate the year’s end with us?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2021_0_3
TEXT: I hope you’ll take a moment to reflect on all the ways you’ve grown and the adventures we had these last 12 months.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2021_0_4
TEXT: We achieved the impossible, created legends, and discovered so much about ourselves! Which moment are you most proud of?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2021_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%. Wow, just look at all the Pokémon you’ve caught! Up for another challenge?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2021_1_1
TEXT: Will you evolve a few of them for me? I’d say you’ve evolved plenty yourself, as a Trainer, this year. Especially after all that time with Hoopa.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2021_1_2
TEXT: What mischief it made this year—remember when it summoned all those Legendary Pokémon?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2021_1_3
TEXT: The bond between Trainer and Pokémon can change so much more than just a Pokémon’s appearance.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2021_1_4
TEXT: Just something to think about as you evolve your Pokémon today!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2021_2_0
TEXT: With a new year just around the corner, I can’t help but look back. What can we learn from the histories of places, Pokémon, and our fellow Trainers?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2021_2_1
TEXT: That reminds me—have you heard about the strange door I found recently? I have a feeling we’re in for quite an adventure!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2021_2_2
TEXT: I wonder what mysteries hide behind that door. What can this relic tell us about the past—and our shared future...?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2021_2_3
TEXT: Sorry, where were we? Ah, yes! Be sure to catch lots of Pokémon, study how they evolve, and maybe work on improving your Poké Ball throws, too. Let’s end the year awash in new knowledge!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2021_3_0
TEXT: You’ve made it to the end, %PLAYERNAME%! Here’s a reward for all your hard work. Consider it a token of my gratitude as well, for all you’ve done for me this year.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2021_3_1
TEXT: I look forward to our adventures together next year! Are you ready? Then let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! Quite an eventful few months we’ve had, eh?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_0_1
TEXT: How are things with Hoopa? You two seem to get along great from what I can tell.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_0_10
TEXT: The poem lines up with the fact that Hoopa has multiple forms: Hoopa Confined and Hoopa Unbound.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_0_11
TEXT: What’s more, I feel a sort of...mysterious power emanating from the bottle. The patterns on it seem reminiscent of Hoopa, don’t you think?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_0_12
TEXT: It’s all got me tremendously excited! We’ve been trying to learn more about Hoopa for a while now, and I have a feeling this may be the final piece of the puzzle.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_0_13
TEXT: Naturally, I’ll need your help to put it all together, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_0_14
TEXT: Can you see what you can learn in the field while I stay here to analyze the poem and bottle?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_0_2
TEXT: I suspect its trust in you must have deepened after you protected it from Team GO Rocket.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_0_3
TEXT: While you and Hoopa have been out adventuring together, my research into the mystery surrounding Hoopa has taken some strange turns.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_0_4
TEXT: I was up late poring over my notes recently when I heard a knock at the door of my mobile lab. I certainly wasn’t expecting anyone, but I figured it would be rude not to answer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_0_5
TEXT: As I approached the door, I heard something scurrying away, and when I opened it, I found nothing but a curious bottle at my feet.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_0_6
TEXT: There was a note attached. I’ve managed to decipher only part of it, but here’s what I’ve got so far.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_0_7
TEXT: “Offer sweets and dust you’ve found 
So Hoopa’s form will be unbound

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_0_9
TEXT: Poetry isn’t exactly my forte, but it’s got a pleasant rhyme structure, I’d say!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_1_0
TEXT: Thanks for your help, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_1_1
TEXT: I’ve been busy analyzing the poem and the bottle it came with—and I have something to share!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_1_2
TEXT: The poem seems to be providing hints as to how to change Hoopa’s form—and I believe this bottle is somehow involved in that process.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_1_3
TEXT: With that said, the bottle’s power appears to be dormant. But with more research, I’m confident we can find a way to harness it and change Hoopa’s form!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_1_4
TEXT: After all we’ve overcome to get this far, I have no doubt the two of us can crack this together.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_1_5
TEXT: Will you help me conduct some more research so we can witness Hoopa’s other form?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_2_0
TEXT: Eureka! %PLAYERNAME%, I’ve just had a massive breakthrough.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_2_1
TEXT: Remember this part of the poem? 
“Offer sweets and dust you’ve found 
So Hoopa’s form will be unbound”

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_2_10
TEXT: Hoopa Unbound is said to be tremendously powerful—but I think you can handle it, Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_2_11
TEXT: It’s been a long adventure with Hoopa, but I think we’ve finally reached the end.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_2_12
TEXT: It’s almost bittersweet, don’t you think? But fret not—I’m sure more discoveries await!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_2_13
TEXT: Let’s keep adventuring through this world full of mysteries—you, me, and Hoopa!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_2_2
TEXT: I believe the poem is telling us to use Hoopa Candy and Stardust to change Hoopa’s form!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_2_3
TEXT: You can get Stardust by catching Pokémon and battling in raids, but you can earn Hoopa Candy only by adventuring with Hoopa as your buddy.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_2_4
TEXT: Luckily, I’ve managed to convert the bottle’s power into Hoopa Candy. Once you’ve gathered everything you need, you’ll be able to change your Hoopa Confined into Hoopa Unbound.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_2_5
TEXT: There’s another bit of the poem that I think is relevant here, too.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_2_6
TEXT: “And in this form it shall remain 
Until an offering is made again.”

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_2_7
TEXT: It sounds like you’ll also need Hoopa Candy and Stardust to change Hoopa Unbound back into Hoopa Confined—but something tells me you won’t need quite as much.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_2_8
TEXT: Of course, this is all just a theory.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_2_9
TEXT: We’ll have to test it before reaching any proper conclusions!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! It’s great to see you again.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_0_1
TEXT: I wanted to tell you about what I saw on my morning walk today—a herd of Spheal rolling across an icy lake!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_0_2
TEXT: Did you know that a Spheal always travels by rolling around on its ball-like body?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_0_3
TEXT: When the season for ice floes arrives, Spheal can be seen rolling about on ice and crossing the sea.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_0_4
TEXT: They’re also covered in fluffy fur to keep them from feeling cold in icy climes. And I’ll tell you, seeing them tumble to-and-fro warmed me right up, too!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_0_5
TEXT: Why don’t you go check out some Spheal for yourself?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! I see you’ve brought some Spheal with you. Aren’t they just the roundest?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_1_1
TEXT: According to my research, the Evolution of Spheal, Sealeo, seems to agree! Sealeo can occasionally be seen entertaining itself by balancing a Spheal on its nose as if juggling a ball.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_1_2
TEXT: In fact, when Sealeo sees just about anything for the first time, it tends to try juggling it on its nose! Why don’t you evolve your Spheal and see for yourself?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_2_0
TEXT: Welcome back, Trainer—and hello there, Sealeo!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_2_1
TEXT: I have some breaking news for you. Remember that icy lake I told you about earlier?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_2_2
TEXT: Well, it looks like something’s broken it up, and now all the Spheal are splashing around in the water! They seem to be having fun, but I wonder what Pokémon could have caused this.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_2_3
TEXT: My best guess is Walrein. Walrein is known to swim through frigid water while crushing icebergs with its grand, imposing tusks. Sounds pretty magnificent, if a bit imposing.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_2_4
TEXT: Can you evolve your Sealeo so we can research Walrein ourselves?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_3_0
TEXT: You did it, Trainer! Walrein’s tusks really are magnificent up close, aren’t they?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_3_1
TEXT: Did you know that Walrein typically gather in herds of about 20 or 30? When a threat appears, the herd’s leader will do whatever it takes to protect the group.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_3_2
TEXT: Nice to know they can look after themselves—though considering those tusks, I don’t think that was ever in doubt. Haha!
