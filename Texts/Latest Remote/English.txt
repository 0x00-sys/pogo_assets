RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_0_1
TEXT: Seems like I’ve been getting goosebumps every few minutes lately! Is it just drafty, or are all the Ghost-type Pokémon we’ve been seeing somehow involved?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_0_2
TEXT: Either way, I think we’re in for another adventure! Whatever happens, we’ll face it together.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_0_3
TEXT: Speaking of faces, I’ve noticed a lot of Yamask in the area lately.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_0_4
TEXT: I’ve been hoping to do some research on it and other Ghost-type Pokémon, so it seems like now’s the time.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_0_5
TEXT: Mind lending me a hand, Trainer?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_1_0
TEXT: Ah—a Yamask AND a Duskull!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_1_1
TEXT: I recently had an encounter with a Duskull that seemed creepy at first but ended up being quite heartwarming.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_1_2
TEXT: It was a lovely reminder not to judge a Pokémon by its...well, skull, I suppose!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_1_3
TEXT: Now, about that Yamask.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_1_4
TEXT: Known as the Spirit Pokémon, Yamask is said to wander through ruins by night carrying a mask that was once its human face.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_1_5
TEXT: A rather melancholy existence, if true, wouldn’t you say?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_1_6
TEXT: What must it feel like to carry around a mask of your former self? No offense to Yamask, but I hope I never have to find out firsthand.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_1_7
TEXT: Did you know that Yamask found in Galar are different than those found in Unova?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_1_8
TEXT: Perhaps you’ll come across one while you’re out conducting research.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_1_9
TEXT: I wonder just how these Yamask differ. Let’s go find out!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_2_1
TEXT: Unlike Yamask first found in Unova, Galarian Yamask carries a slab rather than a mask.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_2_2
TEXT: It’s said that the slab bears cursed engravings and possesses Yamask itself. Talk about spooky!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_2_3
TEXT: Oh, and you’ve encountered a Banette, too! Did you know that Banette is said to be a doll that became a Pokémon through the power of its grudge toward the child that disowned it?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_2_5
TEXT: Between Galarian Yamask’s slab, Banette’s puppet body, and all the Pokémon in costumes walking around, it feels like the spooky factor’s turned way up at the moment!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_2_6
TEXT: Even so, I’d still like to learn more about Ghost-type Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_2_7
TEXT: Come on, Trainer—let’s get back out there!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_3_0
TEXT: Looks like we’re coming up on the last stretch of our research here, Trainer. And hey, it looks like you found yourself an Alolan Marowak!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_3_1
TEXT: Did you know that the bones used by some Marowak belonged to their mothers?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_3_2
TEXT: In fact, Cubone—which evolves into Marowak—is even said to wear the skull of its mother.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_3_3
TEXT: When Cubone evolves into Alolan Marowak, its mother’s regrets protect it like a vengeful spirit.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_3_4
TEXT: Hmm. Between Alolan Marowak, Banette, and Yamask, we’ve witnessed the power of quite a few spirits, haven’t we?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_3_5
TEXT: Try as I might to explain why Ghost-type Pokémon seem spooky, sometimes I just come up blank. But that won’t stop me from continuing to try!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_3_6
TEXT: After all, I always feel like I learn a bit more about myself when I’m studying Pokémon. You know what I mean?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_3_7
TEXT: Anyway, I think we’re more than due some rest and treats after all that research. See you next time, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_0_0
TEXT: Hi there! It’s so nice to meet you %PLAYERNAME%. My name is Professor Willow, I’m a researcher of Pokémon and will be guiding you on your Trainer journey—and what a journey it’ll be!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_0_1
TEXT: You’ll also be helping me a ton with my research along the way.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_0_2
TEXT: First things first, you’ll need to learn how to do three things: catch Pokémon, throw a Curveball, and transfer Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_0_3
TEXT: You can catch Pokémon with a Poké Ball.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_0_4
TEXT: Depending on how expertly you aim your Poké Ball at the center of the Pokémon and the timing of your throw, you can achieve Nice, Great, or Excellent throws.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_0_5
TEXT: Curveballs are more advanced throws you can make that can help you grow as a Trainer too. Simply spin the ball as you throw it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_0_6
TEXT: It’s OK if you don’t get it at first—practice makes perfect after all!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_0_7
TEXT: Once you’ve caught some Pokémon, you can keep them in your Pokémon Inventory or transfer them to my mobile lab in return for that Pokémon’s Candy.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_0_8
TEXT: Don’t worry about Candy for now, I’ll explain more about that later on. Now let’s GO and catch some Pokémon,  shall we?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_1_0
TEXT: Hello again, %PLAYERNAME%! How was catching and transferring Pokémon? Not too bad after the first few tries, right?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_1_1
TEXT: Soon you’ll be throwing Excellent Curveballs as naturally as a Water-type Pokémon swims in water!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_1_2
TEXT: I’d like to talk to you about an item that I’ve created with my research called Incense.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_1_3
TEXT: It emits a fragrance that is irresistible to Pokémon, making them come to you, instead of having you go to them! Handy, eh?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_1_4
TEXT: This tool is surely an important one that any Trainer should have in their Items.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_1_5
TEXT: Speaking of items, have you heard of Berries? There are several Berries that Pokémon enjoy eating, and they each have different effects. For example: the Nanab Berry.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_1_6
TEXT: Nanab Berries calm active Pokémon down to make aiming your Poké Ball an easier task.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_1_7
TEXT: Let’s give one a try, shall we? Go ahead and use an Incense and then a Nanab Berry to help you catch a new Pokémon friend!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_2_0
TEXT: Hello, %PLAYERNAME%! Great work catching those Pokémon with the help of those Berries.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_2_1
TEXT: If you’re ever running low on Berries or Poké Balls, you can always stop by your nearest PokéStop to get more!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_2_2
TEXT: Spinning the Photo Disc will grant you those items and sometimes other extra goodies too, as well as grant you Field Research tasks to do to encounter more Pokémon or receive more items.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_2_3
TEXT: PokéStops are usually located at interesting places, like a building, a public park, or a local café.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_2_4
TEXT: They appear to encourage Trainers to explore new places they might never have considered exploring before. Isn’t that exciting?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_2_5
TEXT: Let’s get to exploring then!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_3_0
TEXT: Aren’t discovering new places fun? What I love best about being a professor that specializes in field research is that my curiosity always takes me to new and exciting locations.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_3_1
TEXT: I hope you got to learn a bit more about the world around you while exploring those PokéStops!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_3_2
TEXT: You know what always makes adventures more fun? Why, that’s a buddy of course!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_3_3
TEXT: Any Pokémon can become a Buddy Pokémon with enough love and care—they’ll even walk alongside you while you’re out exploring!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_3_4
TEXT: An important part of being a good Trainer is cultivating your relationship with your Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_3_5
TEXT: You can do this by playing with them, giving them treats, taking photos of them, and battling with them.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_3_6
TEXT: When you do, your friendship with them will improve and they’ll join you on your adventure.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_3_7
TEXT: Eventually, they can even become your Best Buddy and gain a Best Buddy ribbon! When walking around with you, you can also earn additional Candy with them.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_3_8
TEXT: We’ll cover the importance of Candy when you come back, but for now, how about you pick your favorite Pokémon and spend some time with them?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_4_0
TEXT: Hey there %PLAYERNAME%! Wow, your buddy’s lookin’ pretty happy! Call me a softie, but seeing Pokémon happy always makes me feel happy too.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_4_1
TEXT: When we take care of our Pokémon, they care of us back and I think that’s just neat.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_4_2
TEXT: I see you’ve earned some Candy while exploring with your buddy! It’s now time to learn about what we use Candy for: powering up and Evolving Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_4_3
TEXT: The Candy you earn from catching, transferring, and adventuring with Pokémon can be used in this way.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_4_4
TEXT: Another resource that you need is Stardust, which can be earned by catching and hatching Pokémon, and from other places too like completing research and opening Gifts.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_4_5
TEXT: Evolving Pokémon helps you complete your Pokédex and learn all about your Pokémon’s potential! There are even some Pokémon that evolve in unique ways.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_4_6
TEXT: Be sure to check your Pokémon’s page to learn more about how to Evolve them. If you’re interested in making your Pokémon stronger, then Powering Up is the way to go.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_4_7
TEXT: You can also ask your Team Leader to appraise your Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_4_8
TEXT: You should have a pretty hefty supply of Candy and Stardust built up from completing the previous research tasks. Let’s get to evolving and powering up some Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_5_0
TEXT: Incredible work, %PLAYERNAME%! Your Pokémon look stronger than ever. Did you learn anything new when evolving or powering up your Pokémon?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_5_1
TEXT: When I see a Pokémon discover new possibilities within itself, it makes me feel like I’m capable of anything too!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_5_2
TEXT: However, there’s just as much to learn about Pokémon in some of their earliest forms too—specifically ones from Eggs!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_5_3
TEXT: You guessed it, the next thing we’re going to learn about are Eggs and Pokémon that can hatch from them.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_5_4
TEXT: There are 2 km, 5 km, and 10 km that you can receive by spinning PokéStops, 7 km Eggs that you can receive by opening Gifts.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_5_5
TEXT: To hatch these Eggs, you’ll need to place them in an Incubator and travel the distance indicated!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_5_6
TEXT: Some Incubators help Eggs hatch faster by decreasing the distance needed to explore, so be wise and intentional with which ones to use when.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_5_7
TEXT: There are other Eggs as well, such as Strange Eggs that you can receive by defeating Team GO Rocket Leaders.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_5_8
TEXT: You shouldn’t worry about encountering them soon, but when you do, you’ll have a chance to receive one of these 12 km Eggs from those battles.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_5_9
TEXT: You should have a handful of Eggs in your bag already. Let’s get to hatching some, shall we?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_6_0
TEXT: Look at all the adorable Pokémon you’ve hatched, %PLAYERNAME%! What an accomplishment, I know you must’ve traveled quite a bit to hatch these little ones.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_6_1
TEXT: Being a dedicated Trainer takes quite a bit of work, don’t you say? However—we can’t forget to have a little bit of fun too!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_6_2
TEXT: You’ll see in your Bag that you have a Camera. You can use this Camera to take snapshots of your Pokémon to commemorate all sorts of moments and memories.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_6_3
TEXT: Snapshots can be taken from three places: when encountering wild Pokémon, from viewing your Pokémon in your Box, and when interacting with your buddy.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_6_4
TEXT: Let’s give it a shot! A...snapshot, that is, ha ha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_7_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, I am looking through the photos you took and I have to say I’m quite impressed!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_7_1
TEXT: Have you considered moonlighting as a Pokémon photographer? You have the chops for it, that’s for sure!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_7_10
TEXT: I’d like you to also learn how to battle effectively, so try to use a Pokémon that has a Charged Attack that’s Super Effective against the types of Pokémon currently defending that Gym.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_7_11
TEXT: Different Pokémon and their moves have different types, and those types have weaknesses to other types.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_7_12
TEXT: For example, Fire-type Pokémon are weak against Water-type moves. Be strategic in battle, %PLAYERNAME%! I know you can do it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_7_13
TEXT: Let’s see what you’re made of, %PLAYERNAME%! Get out there and battle in some Gyms.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_7_2
TEXT: While you’ve been adventuring and taking photos, I’m sure you’ve come across these structures.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_7_3
TEXT: They’re bigger than PokéStops and come in four colors, depending on which team (or a lack thereof) is currently controlling it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_7_4
TEXT: They’re called Gyms and being a Trainer also includes knowing how to battle in them!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_7_5
TEXT: Red Gyms are controlled by Team Valor, led by the headstrong Candela, blue Gyms are controlled by Team Mystic, headed up by the analytical Blanche,

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_7_6
TEXT: and yellow Gyms are controlled by Team Instinct, whose proud leader is the incomparable Spark. He’s known for following his gut.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_7_7
TEXT: Gray Gyms are neutral and currently have no team that controls them.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_7_8
TEXT: In Gyms controlled by your team, if there are less than six Pokémon in there already, you can leave Pokémon to defend the Gym on your behalf.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_7_9
TEXT: In Gyms controlled by other teams, you can battle to try to claim it. Find a Gym that’s controlled by a different team and give battling a shot!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_8_0
TEXT: "How was that workout, %PLAYERNAME%? Get it, because you were just battling at a Gym? Ha ha! Just kidding, I know it’s Pokémon battling at them and not you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_8_1
TEXT: Anywho, did you notice that some Gyms you couldn’t battle against its Gym defenders and instead were faced with a single Pokémon?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_8_2
TEXT: Those are called raid bosses and those battles are called Raid Battles!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_8_3
TEXT: Most battles involve one Pokémon fighting another, but in Raid Battles, you can battle alongside friends and other Trainers to take down one Pokémon together.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_8_4
TEXT: These Pokémon are sometimes rare and powerful and can only be found in raids.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_8_5
TEXT: Before entering one, make sure your Pokémon are as powerful as can be! This is where your Candy and Stardust can come into good use—by powering up your most powerful Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_8_6
TEXT: Give that a shot first and then take your chance at a raid. If you don't succeed, find local other local Trainers to team up with.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_8_7
TEXT: You’ll never know what you’re capable of until you try right?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_10_7
TEXT: That’s when I realized that Trevenant was harvesting Berries from the nearby trees to feed the Phantump! Trevenant is known to offer great kindness to forest-dwelling Pokémon, and it was lovely to witness it myself.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_12_0
TEXT: Well hello, %PLAYERNAME%! Welcome back. It’s around this time of year that nights in the Northern Hemisphere begin growing longer and longer. The sun shines brighter while it’s up, though, so it’s a pretty fair trade!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_12_1
TEXT: If you ask me, this is a prime opportunity to ponder the power of light and darkness—both literally and metaphorically. I wonder what darkness our little friend Hoopa has had to overcome? I have a feeling its mischievous reputation may hang over it like a shadow at times.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_12_2
TEXT: What’s more, I can’t help but wonder how and why its power was confined.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_12_3
TEXT: Pokémon are an endless source of mystery. We may never know all their secrets, but it’s a researcher’s job to shine a light into the darkest depths of the unknown and illuminate whatever answers we can!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_12_4
TEXT: For me, darkness is an opportunity to learn something new. To make discoveries! We’ve learned so much about Hoopa in our research, and in some ways, I think we may have learned a bit about ourselves, too.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_12_5
TEXT: But enough of my rambling! How about you head on out there and enjoy the light, %PLAYERNAME%? You’ve earned it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_13_0
TEXT: I’m glad to see you again, Trainer! I was out on a walk and got to thinking about your journey with Hoopa thus far.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_13_1
TEXT: It seems that Hoopa’s really taken a shine to you. Do you think it may show us more of its power soon? A professor can dream, I suppose.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_13_2
TEXT: Why don’t you check back again in a bit, %PLAYERNAME%, after you’ve spent a tad more time with Hoopa.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_14_0
TEXT: I’m glad to see you, %PLAYERNAME%. I wish I had better news, but it looks like Team GO Rocket is stirring up trouble once again!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_14_1
TEXT: While out on patrol, Spark and Candela overheard some Team GO Rocket Grunts discussing the organization’s next move. They want to capture Hoopa! It seems their orders came straight from Giovanni himself.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_14_2
TEXT: I shudder to think that all this time Giovanni may have been lurking in the shadows just behind us, reaping the benefits of our research. Scheming as we studied Hoopa...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_14_3
TEXT: There’s no time to lose—we have to stop them! Hoopa Unbound is incredibly powerful, and I have no doubt that Giovanni intends to use it for some sinister purpose.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_14_4
TEXT: You know better than most, %PLAYERNAME%: Hoopa may be capable of terrifying things, but it’s still a Pokémon. It must be protected!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_14_5
TEXT: We’ve also gotten word that Giovanni has turned another Legendary Pokémon into a Shadow Pokémon! The team leaders and I will do what we can, but we’ll need your help if we’re to defeat Giovanni, save the Legendary Shadow Pokémon, and keep Hoopa safe.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_15_0
TEXT: Incredible work, %PLAYERNAME%! You’ve successfully defeated Team GO Rocket yet again and saved another Legendary Shadow Pokémon—and Hoopa, too!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_15_1
TEXT: Speaking of Hoopa, I have a sneaking suspicion that because of your kindness, we might just be lucky enough to witness it as Hoopa Unbound someday soon. What a sight that will be, eh?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_15_2
TEXT: We’ve come a long way in our research, and unlocking Hoopa’s true power may be the final trial in this mysterious saga. Are you ready, Trainer? Let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_8_2
TEXT: After all those Legendary Pokémon appeared during this year’s GO Fest—as well as those Pokémon first found in Galar that appeared more recently—I’d say Hoopa’s involvement here is more than likely.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shint_0_0
TEXT: Hey there %PLAYERNAME%! Hope you’ve been well.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shint_0_1
TEXT: The strangest thing happened last night: I noticed a veritable bevy of bobbing, blinking lights bouncing around at the far end of a nearby park—but by the time I’d run over, the area was empty and dark.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shint_0_2
TEXT: I have a feeling those flickering lights may somehow be connected to an Electric-type Pokémon, but I can’t be sure!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shint_0_3
TEXT: How about we do a little investigating, hm? Maybe those Pokémon are still nearby.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shint_1_0
TEXT: Well, would you look at that! It’s Shinx, the Flash Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shint_1_1
TEXT: Considering all I’ve heard about this cute little creature, I have a theory.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shint_1_2
TEXT: Shinx sends signals to others of its kind by shaking the tip of its lit-up tail.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shint_1_3
TEXT: Last night’s anomaly was likely a group of Shinx having a chat!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shint_1_4
TEXT: Now that you’ve caught a Shinx, why don’t we do some research into its Evolution, Luxio?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shint_1_5
TEXT: Strong electricity courses through the tips of Luxio’s sharp claws. What a shocking combination! Let’s learn more about it, shall we?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shint_2_0
TEXT: Well done, %PLAYERNAME%—you’ve got yourself a Luxio!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shint_2_1
TEXT: Also known as the Spark Pokémon, Luxio can receive a bit of other Luxio’s electricity by joining their tails together.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shint_2_2
TEXT: So, Shinx can use their tails to communicate with one another, and Luxio can gather their tails together to collectively generate powerful electricity. Fascinating!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shint_2_3
TEXT: I wonder what else there is to learn about this Pokémon’s Evolutionary line. How about you evolve your Luxio and we find out for ourselves!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shint_3_0
TEXT: Ah, Luxray, the Gleam Eyes Pokémon! When its eyes gleam gold, it can spot hidden prey—even through thick walls.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shint_3_1
TEXT: But seeing through solid objects uses a lot of its electricity, so Luxray sleep for long periods of time to store up energy.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shint_3_2
TEXT: What an electrifying revelation! We’ve learned a lot about Shinx and its Evolutions, but I bet there’s still much to discover.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shint_3_3
TEXT: Despite all that hard work, it seems you’ve still got a little spark left in you—so why don’t you head back out and see what other adventures await? Let’s GO!
