RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_3_6
TEXT: Thundurus is known as the Bolt Strike Pokémon, and its story also references both Incarnate and Therian Formes. The spikes on its tail are said to discharge immense bolts of lightning.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_4_6
TEXT: I was pretty pleased to be dreaming of those Unovan Legendary Pokémon again, so I suspect Munna’s mist was nice and rosy that day!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! Perfect timing.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_0_1
TEXT: I just got back from a lengthy stroll in the sunshine. It’s incredible how much a bit of fresh air can affect your energy and mood!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_0_2
TEXT: But that’s not the only thing that’s got me feeling chipper. You see, I witnessed something quite interesting while I was out and about.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_0_3
TEXT: Perhaps in response to the abundant sunlight, a congregation of Snivy appears to have formed nearby.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_0_4
TEXT: I don’t know about you, but this seems to me like a golden opportunity to research the Grass Snake Pokémon. Could you lend me a hand?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_0_5
TEXT: They’re known to be fairly calm, so you shouldn’t have much trouble observing them.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_0_6
TEXT: Good luck out there!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, Trainer! Great work.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_1_1
TEXT: I have some information for you on why Snivy are so fond of the sun.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_1_2
TEXT: These Grass-type Pokémon photosynthesize by bathing their tails in sunlight. Much like the sunshine they crave, Snivy are quite bright!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_1_3
TEXT: They were first encountered in the Unova region, where they were known for their intelligence and calm demeanor. Fascinating!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_1_4
TEXT: While we continue researching their sudden appearance, could you evolve a Snivy for me? I’d like to document its Evolution, Servine.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_1_5
TEXT: Take care when you do, however—Servine is known for its masterful whipping techniques.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_2_0
TEXT: Wonderful work, %PLAYERNAME%! That’s a mighty fine Servine.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_2_1
TEXT: Like Snivy, Servine is known as the Grass Snake Pokémon. It moves along the ground as if sliding. Though it’s far from sluggish, it won’t hesitate to seek out the shadows of thick foliage to avoid attacks.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_2_2
TEXT: Now that we’ve properly documented Snivy and Servine, I’d like to move on to Serperior, Snivy’s final Evolution.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_2_3
TEXT: Serperior is known as the Regal Pokémon, and much like Snivy and Servine, it also has a penchant for sunlight. It takes in solar energy and boosts it internally.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_2_4
TEXT: Could you evolve your Servine into Serperior for me, Trainer? It’ll be a great boon to my research, and you’ll have a powerful Grass-type Pokémon to join your journey as well!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_3_0
TEXT: Fantastic work, Trainer! I have no doubt Serperior will prove a potent asset on your adventures.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_3_1
TEXT: It has an incredible ability to stop its opponents’ movements with a single glare. Should the opponent prove bold enough to continue, Serperior will give its all in battle.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_3_2
TEXT: Having a Pokémon like that by your side would be pretty inspiring, I’d say!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_3_3
TEXT: Anyway, thanks again for all your help in this sun-soaked endeavor. I think I’ll take one more walk before the day’s done—can’t let weather like this go to waste!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_3_4
TEXT: Until next time, let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_0_0
TEXT: Hello there, %PLAYERNAME%! It's such a lovely day over here, with some incredibly fluffy clouds floating by in the sky.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_0_1
TEXT: I've noticed something quite peculiar, however, which is what appears to be some sudden movement to and fro the clouds.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_0_2
TEXT: My eyes must be playing tricks on me--I'm certain that clouds do not move about and...flap, like that.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_0_3
TEXT: And it appears to be happening in increasing frequency!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_0_4
TEXT: Mind going on a little jaunt to see what Pokémon might be the cause of this unusual occurrence?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_1_0
TEXT: My heavens...a Swablu! What a darling little creature, wouldn't you say?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_1_1
TEXT: The Cotton Bird Pokémon sure lives up to its name!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_1_2
TEXT: Its cotton-like wings are so fluffy and white, alongside their sky blue bodies, they can be easily mistaken for clouds.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_1_3
TEXT: I guess it wasn't my eyes after all!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_1_4
TEXT: Oh...oh! There it goes! Right on your head.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_1_5
TEXT: Swablu, I hear, love to sit on people's heads. They look like fluffy hats!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_1_6
TEXT: However, if their wings get dirt on them, they'll be inclined to leave and clean themselves.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_1_7
TEXT: What peculiar and particular creatures, aren't they?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_1_8
TEXT: Evolving a Swablu requires quite a bit of Swablu Candy, but their evolved form is quite a sight to see! How about you go out and collect more Candy?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_1_9
TEXT: Be sure to use Pinap Berries when catching more Swablu to get even more Candy!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_2_0
TEXT: Incredible work, %PLAYERNAME%! Looks like you've been hard at work catching Swablu and collecting a ton of Swablu Candy.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_2_1
TEXT: Evolving a Swablu is truly an act of patience, isn't it?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_2_2
TEXT: Patience is often called a virtue in a broad sense, but it's an integral part of being a good Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_2_3
TEXT: Good things come to those who wait is a cliché term for a reason: it's often true!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_2_4
TEXT: And I believe all of your hard work will pay off once you lay your eyes on the wonderful Pokémon that your new Swablu friend will evolve into.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_2_5
TEXT: Just one more leg of this journey left to go, %PLAYERNAME%. Let's go!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_3_0
TEXT: Do you hear that, %PLAYERNAME%? Your newly evolved Swablu is singing in joy!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_3_1
TEXT: This Pokémon is called Altaria, the Humming Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_3_2
TEXT: Oh...oh! Now it's enveloping you in its wings! Altaria do that to people it's bonded with.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_3_3
TEXT: Do you feel its humming? People say that its humming is so melodic and beautiful it could enrapture an entire audience.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_3_4
TEXT: It's really quite incredible to see how fast you and your Altaria have become friends.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_3_5
TEXT: I'm moved and it's not just from its wonderful humming either.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_3_6
TEXT: Anyway, thanks for another Pokémon research adventure, %PLAYERNAME%. I feel like I learn something new about, and from, Pokémon everytime.
