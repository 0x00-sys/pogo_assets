RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0079_2582
TEXT: Although this Pokémon is normally zoned out, its expression abruptly sharpens on occasion. The cause for this seems to lie in Slowpoke's diet.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0080_2583
TEXT: A Shellder bite set off a chemical reaction with the spices inside Slowbro's body, causing Slowbro to become a Poison-type Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0144_g
TEXT: Its feather-like blades are composed of psychic energy and can shear through thick iron sheets as if they were paper.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0146_g
TEXT: This Pokémon’s sinister, flame-like aura will consume the spirit of any creature it hits. Victims become burned-out shadows of themselves.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0199_2584
TEXT: A combination of toxins and the shock of evolving has increased Shellder’s intelligence to the point that Shellder now controls Slowking.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0222_2340

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0720_2652
TEXT: It is said to be able to seize anything it desires with its six rings and six huge arms. With its power sealed, it is transformed into a much smaller form.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0722

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0723
TEXT: Supremely sensitive to the presence of others, it can detect opponents standing behind it, flinging its sharp feathers to take them out.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0724
TEXT: Decidueye can nock and fire an arrow at an enemy in a tenth of a second, so its battles are decided in the blink of an eye.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0725
TEXT: Its coat regrows twice a year. When the time comes, Litten sets its own body on fire and burns away the old fur.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0726
TEXT: When its mane is standing on end, you can tell it's feeling good. When it isn't feeling well, its fur will lie down flat.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0727
TEXT: When its fighting spirit is set alight, the flames around its waist become especially intense.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0728
TEXT: Popplio gets on top of its bouncy water balloons to jump higher. It's quite the acrobatic fighter!

TEXT: Also known as a songstress, it has a fantastical look on moonlit nights when it leads its colony in song.

TEXT: It may look spindly, but its neck muscles are heavy-duty. It can peck at a tree 16 times per second!

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0732
TEXT: From its mouth, it fires the seeds of berries it has eaten. The scattered seeds give rise to new plants.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0733
TEXT: Known for forming harmonious couples, this Pokémon is brought to wedding ceremonies as a good luck charm.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0734
TEXT: Although it will eat anything, it prefers fresh living things, so it marches down streets in search of prey.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0735
TEXT: Patient by nature, this Pokémon loses control of itself and pounces when it spots its favorite meal—Rattata!

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0736
TEXT: It spits a sticky thread to stop opponents in their tracks, and then it grabs them in its sharp, sturdy mandibles to take them down.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0737
TEXT: Its stout shell provides excellent defense from attacks. It uses electricity on persistent opponents.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0738
TEXT: Vikavolt flusters opponents with acrobatic flying maneuvers. This creates an opening for it to deliver an electric beam attack.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0739
TEXT: Crabrawler has been known to mistake Exeggutor for a coconut tree and climb it. The enraged Exeggutor shakes it off and stomps it.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0740
TEXT: Before it stops to think, it just starts pummeling. There are records of its turning back avalanches with a flurry of punches.

TEXT: This Oricorio has sipped purple nectar. Some dancers use its graceful, elegant dancing as inspiration.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0742
TEXT: Cutiefly can pick up the auras of living things. It skillfully reads those auras to predict its foes' movements and make fools of them.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0743
TEXT: It can predict the weather from moisture levels and wind direction. Ribombee only reveals itself when there are a few clear days in a row.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0744
TEXT: When it rubs the rocks on its neck against you, that's proof of its love for you. However, the rocks are sharp, so the gesture is quite painful!

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0745
TEXT: The rocks in its mane are sharper than a knife. Fragments that break off are treasured as good luck charms.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0748
TEXT: With its 12 legs, it creates a dome to shelter within. The flow of the tides doesn't affect Toxapex in there, so it's very comfortable.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0749
TEXT: Possessing mighty power, Mudbray can be loaded with 50 times its own body weight and will be totally fine.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0750
TEXT: It can trudge mountain roads without rest for three days and three nights, all the while dragging a 10-ton load.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0751
TEXT: It can only breathe oxygen that has dissolved in water, so it wears a water bubble on its head when it walks around on land.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0752
TEXT: It has a habit of storing things it values in its water bubble. If its Trainer doesn't watch out, Araquanid will try to put them in its bubble!

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0753
TEXT: It loves the sunshine. When it basks in the sunlight regularly, it grows up with vivid coloration.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0754
TEXT: As it slashes into its enemies, it looks like it's dancing. Its elegant appearance has led some to call it the most glamorous Grass Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0755
TEXT: It likes damp dark places. When night falls, the spores filling the caps of its mushrooms glow.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0756
TEXT: When it starts fighting for territory with Parasect, the entire area gets completely coated in spores!

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0757
TEXT: It weakens opponents and sends them reeling with its poisonous gas. Salandit doesn't deal well with Spinda, since it's always reeling.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0758
TEXT: It punishes Salandit that couldn't bring it food with a fierce slap of its flame-spewing palm.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0759

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0760
TEXT: It boasts tremendous physical strength. Many people call it the most dangerous Pokémon in the Alola region.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0761
TEXT: It tries to resist being swallowed by a bird Pokémon by spinning the sepals on its head. It's usually a fruitless attempt.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0762
TEXT: It bounces around, swinging the sepals on its head with abandon. They're quite painful when they smack you!

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0763
TEXT: A Pokémon with an aggressive personality and a mastery of kicking, it cackles every time it kicks an opponent.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0764
TEXT: It picks flowers and sticks them to its body with fluids it produces. The aroma that wafts from its petals has a healing effect.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0765
TEXT: Oranguru don't get along with each other, so they're always engaging in battles of wits to decide which one is superior.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0766
TEXT: Berries are its weapons as well as the staple of its diet. The one that can throw a berry the farthest is the boss of the troop.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0767
TEXT: An astonishingly cowardly Pokémon, Wimpod will whir its legs at high speeds to run away if anything comes near it.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0768
TEXT: Its claws, which it can extend and retract at will, are its greatest weapons. Golisopod is sometimes accompanied by Wimpod.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0769
TEXT: If you build sand mounds when you're playing, destroy them before you go home, or they may get possessed and become Sandygast.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0770
TEXT: Once it has whipped up a sandstorm to halt its opponents in their tracks, this terrifying Pokémon snatches away their vitality.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0771
TEXT: Its entire body is covered in its own slime. If you accidentally step on one, you'll slip, and it will get mad and smack you!

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0772
TEXT: There's danger of its going on a rampage, so its true power is sealed away beneath its control mask.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0773
TEXT: Through the bond it formed with its Trainer, its will was strengthened, and it was able to destroy its control mask.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0773_disc
TEXT: Its capacity to change types unleashed, it shines silver due to the energy springing forth from within.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0773_normal
TEXT: Through the bond it formed with its Trainer, its will was strengthened, and it was able to destroy its control mask.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0774
TEXT: Although its outer shell is uncommonly durable, the shock of falling to the ground smashes the shell to smithereens.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0774_exposed
TEXT: This is its form when its shell has fallen off. The color of its core depends on the materials that made up the food it ate.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0774_meteor
TEXT: Although its outer shell is uncommonly durable, the shock of falling to the ground smashes the shell to smithereens.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0775
TEXT: It remains asleep from birth to death as a result of the sedative properties of the leaves that form its diet.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0776
TEXT: Its exploding shell poses a real danger but is sensitive to moisture. On rainy days, Turtonator takes silent refuge in caves.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0777
TEXT: Its capacity to produce electricity is somewhat limited, so it gets charged up by letting lightning strike it!

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0778
TEXT: A gust of wind revealed what hides under this Pokémon's rag to a passing Trainer, who went home and died painfully that very night.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0779
TEXT: Its skin is thick enough to fend off Mareanie's spikes. With its robust teeth, Bruxish crunches up the spikes and eats them.

TEXT: Its chain-like green seaweed can stretch outward for hundreds of yards. For some reason, it gets along well with Skrelp.

TEXT: The scales it sheds can be molded and processed to make pots and pans. They conduct heat well, so they're a popular item.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0784
TEXT: It battles valiantly with its fists, which are armored in steel scales. Kommo-o specializes in uppercuts.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0785
TEXT: The lightning-wielding guardian deity of Melemele, Tapu Koko is brimming with curiosity and appears before people from time to time.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0786
TEXT: Although called a guardian deity, Tapu Lele is devoid of guilt about its cruel disposition and can be described as nature incarnate.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0787
TEXT: It makes ringing sounds with its tail to let others know where it is, avoiding unneeded conflicts. This guardian deity of Ula'ula controls plants.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0788
TEXT: Although it's called a guardian deity, terrible calamities sometimes befall those who recklessly approach Tapu Fini.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0789
TEXT: Whether or not it's a Pokémon from this world is a mystery. When it's in a jam, it warps away to a safe place to hide.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0790

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0792
TEXT: It sometimes summons unknown powers and life-forms here to this world from holes that lead to other worlds.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0795
TEXT: A life-form that lives in another world, its body is thin and supple, but it also possesses great power.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0796
TEXT: They've been dubbed Ultra Beasts. Some of them stand unmoving, like trees, with their arms and legs stuck into the ground.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0797
TEXT: One of the dangerous UBs, high energy readings can be detected coming from both of its huge arms.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0798
TEXT: This Ultra Beast's body, which is as thin as paper, is like a sharpened sword.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0799
TEXT: An unknown life-form called a UB. It may be constantly hungry—it is certainly always devouring something.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0800
TEXT: Light is the source of its energy. If it isn't devouring light, impurities build up in it and on it, and Necrozma darkens and stops moving.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0801
TEXT: Built roughly 500 years ago by a scientist, the part called the Soul-Heart is the actual life-form.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0802
TEXT: It sinks into the shadows of people and Pokémon, where it can understand their feelings and copy their capabilities.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0803
TEXT: An Ultra Beast that lives in a different world, it cackles wildly as it sprays its opponents with poison from the needles on its head.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0804
TEXT: One kind of Ultra Beast, it fires a glowing, venomous liquid from its needles. This liquid is also immensely adhesive.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0805
TEXT: When stone walls started moving and attacking, the brute's true identity was this mysterious life-form, which brings to mind an Ultra Beast.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0806
TEXT: A UB that appeared from an Ultra Wormhole, it causes explosions, then takes advantage of opponents' surprise to rob them of their vitality.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0807
TEXT: It approaches its enemies at the speed of lightning, then tears them limb from limb with its sharp claws.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0810
TEXT: When it uses its special stick to strike up a beat, the sound waves produced carry revitalizing energy to the plants and flowers in the area.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0811
TEXT: The faster a Thwackey can beat out a rhythm with its two sticks, the more respect it wins from its peers.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0812
TEXT: By drumming, it taps into the power of its special tree stump. The roots of the stump follow its direction in battle.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0813
TEXT: A warm-up of running around gets fire energy coursing through this Pokémon's body. Once that happens, it's ready to fight at full power.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0814
TEXT: Its thick and fluffy fur protects it from the cold and enables it to use hotter fire moves.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0815
TEXT: It juggles a pebble with its feet, turning it into a burning soccer ball. Its shots strike opponents hard and leave them scorched.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0816
TEXT: When scared, this Pokémon cries. Its tears pack the chemical punch of 100 onions, and attackers won't be able to resist weeping.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0817
TEXT: A clever combatant, this Pokémon battles using water balloons created with moisture secreted from its palms.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0818
TEXT: It has many hidden capabilities, such as fingertips that can shoot water and a membrane on its back that it can use to glide through the air.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0819
TEXT: Found throughout the Galar region, this Pokémon becomes uneasy if its cheeks are ever completely empty of berries.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0820
TEXT: It stashes berries in its tail—so many berries that they fall out constantly. But this Pokémon is a bit slow-witted, so it doesn't notice the loss.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0821
TEXT: It will bravely challenge any opponent, no matter how powerful. This Pokémon benefits from every battle—even a defeat increases its strength a bit.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0822
TEXT: Smart enough to use tools in battle, these Pokémon have been seen picking up rocks and flinging them or using ropes to wrap up enemies.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0823
TEXT: This Pokémon reigns supreme in the skies of the Galar region. The black luster of its steel body could drive terror into the heart of any foe.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0824
TEXT: A constant collector of information, this Pokémon is very smart. Very strong is what it isn't.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0825
TEXT: It barely moves, but it's still alive. Hiding in its shell without food or water seems to have awakened its psychic powers.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0826
TEXT: It's famous for its high level of intelligence, and the large size of its brain is proof that it also possesses immense psychic power.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0827
TEXT: Aided by the soft pads on its feet, it silently raids the food stores of other Pokémon. It survives off its ill-gotten gains.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0828
TEXT: It secretly marks potential targets with a scent. By following the scent, it stalks its targets and steals from them when they least expect it.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0829
TEXT: It anchors itself in the ground with its single leg, then basks in the sun. After absorbing enough sunlight, its petals spread as it blooms brilliantly.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0830
TEXT: The seeds attached to its cotton fluff are full of nutrients. It spreads them on the wind so that plants and other Pokémon can benefit from them.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0831
TEXT: Its curly fleece is such an effective cushion that this Pokémon could fall off a cliff and stand right back up at the bottom, unharmed.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0832
TEXT: Weave a carpet from its springy wool, and you end up with something closer to a trampoline. You'll start to bounce the moment you set foot on it.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0833
TEXT: Apparently the itch of its teething impels it to snap its jaws at anything in front of it.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0834
TEXT: With jaws that can shear through steel rods, this highly aggressive Pokémon chomps down on its unfortunate prey.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0835
TEXT: This Pokémon is very popular as a herding dog in the Galar region. As it runs, it generates electricity from the base of its tail.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0836
TEXT: This Pokémon generates electricity and channels it into its legs to keep them going strong. Boltund can run nonstop for three full days.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0837
TEXT: Most of its body has the same composition as coal. Fittingly, this Pokémon was first discovered in coal mines about 400 years ago.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0838
TEXT: It forms coal inside its body. Coal dropped by this Pokémon once helped fuel the lives of people in the Galar region.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0839
TEXT: It's usually peaceful, but the vandalism of mines enrages it. Offenders will be incinerated with flames that reach 2,700 degrees Fahrenheit.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0840
TEXT: It spends its entire life inside an apple. It hides from its natural enemies, bird Pokémon, by pretending it's just an apple and nothing more.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0841
TEXT: It ate a sour apple, and that induced its evolution. In its cheeks, it stores an acid capable of causing chemical burns.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0842
TEXT: Eating a sweet apple caused its evolution. A nectarous scent wafts from its body, luring in the bug Pokémon it preys on.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0843
TEXT: As it digs, it swallows sand and stores it in its neck pouch. The pouch can hold more than 17 pounds of sand.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0844
TEXT: When it contracts its body, over 220 pounds of sand sprays from its nose. If it ever runs out of sand, it becomes disheartened.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0845
TEXT: It's so strong that it can knock out some opponents in a single hit, but it also may forget what it's battling midfight.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0845_gorging
TEXT: This Cramorant has accidentally gotten a Pikachu lodged in its gullet. Cramorant is choking a little, but it isn't really bothered.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0845_gulping
TEXT: Cramorant's gluttony led it to try to swallow an Arrokuda whole, which in turn led to Cramorant getting an Arrokuda stuck in its throat.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0845_regular
TEXT: It's so strong that it can knock out some opponents in a single hit, but it also may forget what it's battling midfight.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0846
TEXT: If it sees any movement around it, this Pokémon charges for it straightaway, leading with its sharply pointed jaw. It's very proud of that jaw.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0847
TEXT: This Pokémon has a jaw that's as sharp as a spear and as strong as steel. Apparently Barraskewda's flesh is surprisingly tasty, too.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0848
TEXT: It stores poison in an internal poison sac and secretes that poison through its skin. If you touch this Pokémon, a tingling sensation follows.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0849
TEXT: When this Pokémon sounds as if it's strumming a guitar, it's actually clawing at the protrusions on its chest to generate electricity.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0849_amped
TEXT: When this Pokémon sounds as if it's strumming a guitar, it's actually clawing at the protrusions on its chest to generate electricity.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0849_lowkey
TEXT: Capable of generating 15,000 volts of electricity, this Pokémon looks down on all that would challenge it.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0850
TEXT: It stores flammable gas in its body and uses it to generate heat. The yellow sections on its belly get particularly hot.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0851
TEXT: When it heats up, its body temperature reaches about 1,500 degrees Fahrenheit. It lashes its body like a whip and launches itself at enemies.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0852
TEXT: It's very curious, but its means of investigating things is to try to punch them with its tentacles. The search for food is what brings it onto land.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0853
TEXT: A body made up of nothing but muscle makes the grappling moves this Pokémon performs with its tentacles tremendously powerful.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0854
TEXT: This Pokémon is said to have been born when a lonely spirit possessed a cold, leftover cup of tea.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0854_antique
TEXT: The swirl pattern in this Pokémon's body is its weakness. If it gets stirred, the swirl loses its shape, and Sinistea gets dizzy.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0854_phony
TEXT: This Pokémon is said to have been born when a lonely spirit possessed a cold, leftover cup of tea.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0855

TEXT: No matter who you are, if you bring strong emotions near this Pokémon, it will silence you violently.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0858
TEXT: It emits psychic power strong enough to cause headaches as a deterrent to the approach of others.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0859
TEXT: Through its nose, it sucks in the emanations produced by people and Pokémon when they feel annoyed. It thrives off this negative energy.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0860
TEXT: When it gets down on all fours as if to beg for forgiveness, it's trying to lure opponents in so that it can stab them with its spear-like hair.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0861
TEXT: With the hair wrapped around its body helping to enhance its muscles, this Pokémon can overwhelm even Machamp.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0864
TEXT: Its shell is overflowing with its heightened otherworldly energy. The ectoplasm serves as protection for this Pokémon's core spirit.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0865
TEXT: Only Farfetch'd that have survived many battles can attain this evolution. When this Pokémon's leek withers, it will retire from combat.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0868

TEXT: When it trusts a Trainer, it will treat them to berries it's decorated with cream.

TEXT: The shaking of its freezing upper half is what generates its electricity. It has a hard time walking around.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0882
TEXT: Powerful legs and jaws made it the apex predator of its time. Its own overhunting of its prey was what drove it to extinction.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0883
TEXT: Though it's able to capture prey by freezing its surroundings, it has trouble eating the prey afterward because its mouth is on top of its head.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0884
TEXT: Its body resembles polished metal, and it's both lightweight and strong. The only drawback is that it rusts easily.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0885

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! Just who I wanted to see. I just received a unique research request regarding a particular Pokémon, and I think you’re the perfect Trainer to help me with it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_0_1
TEXT: Let’s warm up with a few tasks first, and then we can dive into the meat of it!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, Trainer. I have a few more details to share about the research request I received.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_1_1
TEXT: A favorite of new and experienced Trainers alike, Bidoof, the Plump Mouse Pokémon, has been appearing more often of late. Intriguing, no?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_1_2
TEXT: Now, before we continue, I have a very important choice for you to make. Will you focus your research on Bidoof or the Plump Mouse Pokémon?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_1_3
TEXT: Is this a trick question? Who could say! My only advice is to follow your heart. Besides, it’s hard to go wrong when Bidoof is your only option!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_1a_0
TEXT: Great choice, Trainer! For some reason, I just knew you’d pick Bidoof. Don’t ask me how!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_1a_1
TEXT: Bidoof is known for its two large front teeth. Much like Rattata’s teeth, Bidoof’s teeth are continually growing.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_1a_2
TEXT: Speaking of teeth, I have a few tasks that you can sink yours into now!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_1b_0
TEXT: Wonderful choice, Trainer! I had a feeling you’d pick the Plump Mouse Pokémon. Don’t ask me why!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_1b_1
TEXT: Otherwise known as Bidoof, this Normal-type Pokémon is far from ordinary! While only about a foot tall, Bidoof is powerful. It can chew through boulders with its incisors—a feat that makes my jaw hurt to even think about.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_2_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%. Hopefully you got a few good snapshots of Bidoof while conducting your research! I always enjoy seeing the snapshots Trainers take of Pokémon, and I can never get enough of Bidoof!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_2_1
TEXT: Now—according to the research request we received, we must choose to focus our efforts on a Pokémon that has nerves of steel or a Pokémon that nests alongside water.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_2_2
TEXT: I know what you’re thinking: choosing between Bidoof and Bidoof isn’t easy. But, then again, the most important research rarely is!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_2a_0
TEXT: You’re going with Bidoof, huh? I like your style, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_2a_1
TEXT: Bidoof isn’t just cute to look at—it’s more agile and active than it appears! Nothing can perturb it, making it an excellent member of your team. 

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_2a_2
TEXT: I think we could all learn from that steadiness. Channel your inner Bidoof so you can steel your nerves, too!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_2b_0
TEXT: You choose Bidoof, eh? I never doubted it for a second.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_2b_1
TEXT: Bidoof often live in groups by the water where they make their nests. I recall that Bibarel, Bidoof’s Evolution, makes its nest by damming streams with bark and mud.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_2b_2
TEXT: A river dammed by Bibarel will never overflow its banks, which is appreciated by people nearby. Fascinating, don’t you think?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_3_0
TEXT: Thank you, %PLAYERNAME%, for assisting me with this special assignment. I think we all learned that there’s more than meets the eye when it comes to Pokémon—especially Bidoof!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_3_1
TEXT: As a thank-you for your hard work, the team leaders and I prepared a gift for you to help show the world your love and knowledge of the indelible Bidoof. I hope you wear it with the pride it deserves.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_3_2
TEXT: Why don’t you put it on and enjoy a nice walk with your Bidoof? You never know what you might discover! Now, let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_0_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%! Excellent timing.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_0_1
TEXT: I just made a tremendously exciting discovery!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_0_2
TEXT: Earlier today, I was exploring a nearby cave to collect some samples when I noticed a peculiar warmth along one of the walls.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_0_3
TEXT: Suddenly, something jumped out and tried to bite me!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_0_4
TEXT: I quickly realized I had stumbled upon a nest of Gible, the Land Shark Pokémon. Gible is known to react to anything that moves, so sometimes it leaps out and chomps passersby.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_0_5
TEXT: I know it just wanted a nibble, but that’s a nibble too much in my book!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_0_6
TEXT: Anyway, it’s not every day you run into a gaggle of Gible. Do you think you could head out and do some research on their appearance here?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_1_1
TEXT: While you were out tracking down the Land Shark Pokémon, I took a closer look at the cave I was telling you about earlier.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_1_2
TEXT: I was reminded of an interesting tidbit about Gible. It nests inside small, horizontal holes in cave walls warmed by geothermal heat.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_1_3
TEXT: Gible seems to love warm places, and that cave certainly fits the bill.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_1_4
TEXT: We’ve learned a lot about this Dragon- and Ground-type Pokémon, but there’s always more to discover!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_1_5
TEXT: When you’re ready, how about you try evolving your Gible into Gabite?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_2_0
TEXT: Nice job evolving your Gible into Gabite, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_2_1
TEXT: Gabite is known as the Cave Pokémon, and it loves sparkly things.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_2_2
TEXT: It emits ultrasonic waves from protrusions on either side of its head to probe pitch-dark caves.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_2_3
TEXT: What a useful ability! Maybe it could help me avoid bumping into lab equipment in the middle of the night...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_2_4
TEXT: We’ve seen Gible and Gabite, but there’s still one more Evolution we need to document. Come see me when you’ve evolved your Gabite, Trainer!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_3_0
TEXT: Ah! Fantastic work, %PLAYERNAME%. That’s an admirable Garchomp!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_3_1
TEXT: Known as the Mach Pokémon, its body is covered in fine scales that reduce drag, enabling it to fly at high speeds.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_3_2
TEXT: Those scales don’t just reduce wind resistance—their sharp edges also cause injury to any opponent that touches them. Pretty spiffy, eh?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_3_3
TEXT: I think you’ll find Garchomp to be a powerful companion on your adventures.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_3_4
TEXT: And I can’t wait to see how your relationship develops along the way!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_3_5
TEXT: Thanks for all your help today, Trainer. I hope you had a fin-tastic time!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_3_6
TEXT: Now, let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq9_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%. Have you looked up at the sky lately? I thought I’d been staring at reports for too long, but no, there are rainbows everywhere!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq9_0_1
TEXT: That’s not all—I’ve also heard rumors that a mysterious Pokémon has been sighted wherever these rainbows appear. They say rainbows bring good luck, so why not follow one to the end? Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq9_0_2
TEXT: In all seriousness, why don’t you go for a stroll and see for yourself? You never know what we might find!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq9_0_3
TEXT: Keep your eye on the sky, and good luck!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq9_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%. I’m afraid I have some dire news... It sounds like Team GO Rocket’s gotten wind of these sightings and have set out to catch the mysterious Pokémon for themselves.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq9_1_1
TEXT: Perhaps they're looking for a bit of good luck as well! Haha! Well, whatever their motive, we can’t have them creating more powerful Shadow Pokémon. It’s time to do some investigating.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq9_1_2
TEXT: Knowing how large Team GO Rocket’s forces are, I fear they may have already found it, no doubt leaving Shadow Pokémon in their wake. Let’s go catch some Shadow Pokémon and see where they lead us!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq9_2_0
TEXT: Great job rescuing all those Shadow Pokémon, %PLAYERNAME%! I wish we had time to celebrate, but I just discovered that Team GO Rocket caught up to our mysterious Pokémon...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq9_2_1
TEXT: ...and that it’s none other than Ho-Oh, the Rainbow Pokémon! But don’t be discouraged! I truly believe that with enough determination, we can save it, just as we have in the past.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq9_2_2
TEXT: Let’s prep for the gauntlet of battles ahead and gather more information about Ho-Oh’s whereabouts by pursuing more Shadow Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq9_3_0
TEXT: Great job saving even more Shadow Pokémon, %PLAYERNAME%! Through your efforts, we’ve learned that Ho-Oh has been handed off to Giovanni and made into a Shadow Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq9_3_1
TEXT: For now, I want you to find and defeat Arlo, Cliff, and Sierra! Doing so will help us build a Super Rocket Radar that’ll lead us right to Giovanni...and to Ho-Oh! Good luck!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq9_4_0
TEXT: Incredible work, %PLAYERNAME%! With a Super Rocket Radar in hand, we’ll have no problem finding Giovanni. Defeating him in battle, however, is another story entirely...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq9_4_1
TEXT: Still! Seeing how you were able to beat his underlings, I’m certain you’ll come out on top—and save Ho-Oh to boot!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq9_5_0
TEXT: What a magnificent battle, %PLAYERNAME%! Congrats on defeating Giovanni and saving Ho-Oh from his clutches.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq9_5_1
TEXT: Team GO Rocket never rests, so we should continue to be vigilant. In the meantime, why not get to know your newly saved Ho-Oh?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq9_5_2
TEXT: With the right care and a little luck, any Shadow Pokémon can be purified! I wish you the best, %PLAYERNAME%, and I’ll see you next time!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_0_0
TEXT: Hello there, %PLAYERNAME%! I was just taking a moment to admire the weather here. Blue skies abound, with the fluffiest of clouds floating by.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_0_1
TEXT: I’d love to just kick back and enjoy the tranquility of it all, but I’ve observed some of the clouds moving rather...strangely.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_0_2
TEXT: Believe it or not, I believe some of them are actually flapping—yes, like birds!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_0_3
TEXT: The first few times I saw it, I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me, but as the motions grew more frequent, I began to suspect a Pokémon was involved. 

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_0_4
TEXT: Mind going on a little jaunt to see what you can discover?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, Trainer! What have you discovered?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_1_1
TEXT: Ah—Swablu! The Cotton Bird Pokémon. Hmm... It’s all beginning to make sense.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_1_2
TEXT: Swablu’s cotton-like wings are so fluffy and white that, alongside their sky-blue bodies, Swablu can be easily mistaken for clouds in the sky.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_1_3
TEXT: At least until you catch them flapping, eh? Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_1_4
TEXT: Swablu apparently love to sit on people’s heads. They look like fluffy hats!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_1_5
TEXT: Ah, and there it goes! Right on your head. Good timing, Swablu!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_1_6
TEXT: Fond as they are of their human perches, Swablu will take flight right away if their wings get dirty. Cleanliness begets comfort, after all.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_1_7
TEXT: A fascinating Pokémon through and through, don’t you think?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_1_8
TEXT: Evolving Swablu takes some effort, but I assure you—it’s well worth it! I’m sure a Trainer of your talent could gather the necessary Candy in no time.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_1_9
TEXT: I’d love to see its Evolution in person, so could you evolve your Swablu for me? Be sure to use Pinap Berries to earn even more Candy!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_2_0
TEXT: Incredible work, %PLAYERNAME%! Looks like you’ve been hard at work catching Swablu.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_2_1
TEXT: Evolving Swablu is truly an act of patience, isn’t it?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_2_2
TEXT: Patience is often called a virtue in a broad sense, but it really is an integral part of being a great Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_2_3
TEXT: As the saying goes: good things come to those who wait!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_2_4
TEXT: All your hard work will feel justified once you witness your darling Swablu evolve. Of that, you have my word!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_2_5
TEXT: Just one more leg of this journey left to go, %PLAYERNAME%. Let's go!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_3_0
TEXT: Welcome back, Trainer! I see your efforts have paid off. Well done!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_3_1
TEXT: Swablu’s Evolution, Altaria, is called the Humming Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_3_2
TEXT: It’s known to wrap its wings around the people it’s bonded with—much like yours is doing with you now.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_3_3
TEXT: And humming all the while! You know, people say that Altaria’s humming could enrapture an entire audience with its beauty, and it’s not hard to see why.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_3_4
TEXT: Between Altaria’s song and your remarkable bond, I have to say I’m feeling quite moved!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_3_5
TEXT: You truly are an incredible Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_3_6
TEXT: Thanks for your help on this latest adventure, %PLAYERNAME%. I’ll never get tired of learning more about Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_3_7
TEXT: Now, let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! Glad to see you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_0_1
TEXT: I was just thinking that it’d be interesting to research more about my Buddy Pokémon and the team leaders’ buddies. 

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_0_2
TEXT: The four of us have powerful bonds with our buddies. Blanche has formed a wonderful relationship with Lapras, Candela has had Rapidash since it was a Ponyta, and Spark has developed an electrifying bond with Elekid.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_0_3
TEXT: My buddy is the Mythical Pokémon Meltan. Since Meltan and I met, I’ve been documenting everything I learn about it. And trust me—there’s a lot to learn!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_0_4
TEXT: I’ve actually heard some reports of Meltan sightings recently. Maybe you’ll run into one on your adventures?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_0_5
TEXT: Definitely something to keep an eye out for as we begin our research. But first, let’s stock up on some supplies!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, Trainer! Seems like you’re all set to head out on this research adventure. Why don’t we start by looking at the cool pair that is Blanche and Lapras?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_1_1
TEXT: Known as the Transport Pokémon, Lapras is both Water- and Ice-type. A smart and kindhearted Pokémon, it glides across the surface of the sea while its beautiful song echoes around it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_1_2
TEXT: Lapras are known to have gentle hearts and can even understand human speech. I completely understand why Blanche chose Lapras as a buddy.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_1_3
TEXT: That said, Blanche clearly feels a special connection to Lapras.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_1_4
TEXT: Blanche got Lapras by trading with a fellow Team Mystic Trainer. I wonder if that has something to do with it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_1_5
TEXT: At any rate, let’s focus our research on Water- and Ice-type Pokémon to learn more about the Pokémon that Blanche holds dear.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_2_0
TEXT: Excellent work, %PLAYERNAME%. It looks like you have your very own Lapras, just like Blanche! 

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_2_1
TEXT: Be sure to tell your Lapras I said hi! I never miss a chance to greet new Pokémon. Now, let’s move on to our next dynamic duo: Spark and Elekid.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_2_2
TEXT: The leader of Team Instinct has always had a soft spot for Pokémon that hatch from Eggs, so it’s only natural that he’d have a buddy like Elekid.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_2_3
TEXT: But don’t let this Pokémon’s small stature fool you! Spark’s Elekid is incredibly powerful, making it a fitting buddy for the energetic team leader.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_2_4
TEXT: Why hasn’t Spark evolved his Elekid? Well, Evolution should be approached with care.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_2_5
TEXT: I’m sure Spark will know when Elekid is ready to evolve.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_2_6
TEXT: Spark may seem pretty carefree, but few are more committed to the care and training of Pokémon than him.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_2_7
TEXT: What do you say we research some Electric-type Pokémon that Spark tends to work with?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_3_0
TEXT: How did your research go, Trainer? I think it’s time to turn our attention to some Fire-type Pokémon—specifically the Fire Horse Pokémon Rapidash.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_3_1
TEXT: This Pokémon has a competitive streak, making it a great match for Candela, the leader of Team Valor.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_3_2
TEXT: Candela has had her Rapidash since it was a Ponyta, so you can be sure the two of them have been on more than a few adventures.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_3_3
TEXT: Rapidash loves to run and gallop, so Candela always makes sure her Buddy Pokémon has plenty of time and space to do just that.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_3_4
TEXT: That kind of care is critical for building strong, lasting relationships with your Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_3_5
TEXT: Candela’s passion and dedication make her a great role model for her fellow Team Valor members—and everyone, really.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_3_6
TEXT: Maybe researching Fire-type Pokémon will help you learn more about Candela’s fiery spirit?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_4_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! Thanks for conducting that research on Fire-type Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_4_1
TEXT: Now that we’ve learned more about the Pokémon that Blanche, Spark, and Candela call their buddies, it’s time to do some research on my Buddy Pokémon: Meltan.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_4_2
TEXT: I remember when I first met my Meltan. I was out doing some research when I stumbled upon a group of them. I’d never seen a Pokémon like it before, and I wanted to share my findings with my mentor, Professor Oak.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_4_3
TEXT: The group of Meltan eventually departed, but one Meltan stuck around, and we’ve been together ever since!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_4_4
TEXT: At first, I assumed Meltan only stayed to snack on all the metal knickknacks in my mobile lab. But as time passed, our bond grew stronger, and now we’re practically inseparable.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_4_5
TEXT: Our favorite thing is to go on long walks and look for metallic snacks for Meltan. Which reminds me—we still need to look into those reports of Meltan appearing nearby!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_4_6
TEXT: Let’s do some investigating and see if we can find any Meltan, Trainer!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_5_0
TEXT: Well done, Trainer! Thanks to your hard work, you have your very own Meltan!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_5_1
TEXT: I’m sure that if you take the time to build up your relationship, Meltan will evolve into Melmetal in no time!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_5_2
TEXT: Melmetal stands over eight feet tall. By using centrifugal force, Melmetal can use its heavy hex-nut arms to deliver the strongest punches of all Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_5_3
TEXT: But I’m getting ahead of myself. Now is the time to focus on the friendship between you and your Buddy Pokémon—whether it be Meltan or any other Pokémon that you feel a special bond with.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_5_4
TEXT: After studying the bonds the team leaders and I have with our Buddy Pokémon, I hope you feel inspired to find a buddy you can grow with as well.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_5_5
TEXT: I’ve no doubt you and your Buddy Pokémon will achieve some incredible things—and Meltan and I will be cheering you on!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_5_6
TEXT: Thank again for your assistance. Until next time, let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! Good to see you. Do have anything fun planned for today?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_0_1
TEXT: I’ll be attending a picnic with the team leaders, myself.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_0_2
TEXT: I must say, though, I was having a pretty hard time deciding what I should bring. Candela’s in charge of sandwiches, Spark is handling refreshments, and Blanche is bringing shaved ice, so the bases are all pretty well covered.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_0_3
TEXT: Walking always clears my head, so I took a stroll and ended up spotting a large group of Tepig near where I normally pick my go-to snack, Pinap Berries.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_0_4
TEXT: And suddenly—inspiration! Did you know Tepig loves to eat roasted Berries, Trainer?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_0_5
TEXT: The Fire Pig Pokémon blows fire balls through its nose and roasts the berries before it eats them.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_0_6
TEXT: Roasted Berries sound like a great picnic snack, don’t you think? And speaking of, I need to start getting them ready. Why don’t you go check out the Tepig in the meantime?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_1_1
TEXT: Ah, I see you’ve caught a Tepig of your own! They make terrific companions in all aspects of life.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_1_2
TEXT: Tepig evolves into Pignite, which, like Tepig, is known as the Fire Pig Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_1_3
TEXT: When Pignite’s internal fire flares up, its movements grow sharper and faster. Whatever it eats becomes fuel for the flame in its stomach. Must do wonders for digestion!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_1_4
TEXT: Oh! That reminds me—I need to check on my roasted Berries.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_1_5
TEXT: While I finish up my picnic preparations, why don’t you see about evolving your Tepig into Pignite?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_2_0
TEXT: Hello again, %PLAYERNAME%. The Berry-roasting process is going swimmingly, and the whole place smells delicious!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_2_1
TEXT: Just when I thought Pokémon couldn’t inspire me any more than they already do, here I am taking cooking tips from Tepig. Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_2_2
TEXT: Nice Pignite, by the way! Very round. Did you know that Pignite can evolve? Its Evolution is a Pokémon called Emboar.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_2_3
TEXT: Emboar is known to heat up its punches by setting its fists ablaze with its fiery chin. It’s also known to care deeply about its friends.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_2_4
TEXT: Speaking of friends, I should let the team leaders know that I’ll be on my way soon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_2_5
TEXT: How about evolving your Pignite into Emboar, Trainer? I’d love to see its fiery beard firsthand.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_3_0
TEXT: Fantastic work, %PLAYERNAME%! Your Emboar is truly a sight to see!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_3_1
TEXT: This powerful Fire- and Fighting-type Pokémon is known as the Mega Fire Pig Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_3_2
TEXT: According to my research, Emboar is a master of fast and powerful Fighting-type attacks.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_3_3
TEXT: And wow... Look at that beard of fire. What do you think, Trainer? Could you see me with one of those?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_3_4
TEXT: Haha, only joking! I’m sure I’d find it far too itchy.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_3_5
TEXT: Anyway, I should let you get back to exploring. And I should get to that picnic!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_3_6
TEXT: Have a wonderful weekend, and keep up all the hard work. It’s always a joy to see how much you’ve grown as a Trainer each time we meet.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_3_7
TEXT: I’ll be in touch soon with some more research opportunities. Or who knows—maybe even some recipes!
