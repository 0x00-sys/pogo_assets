RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0058_2792
TEXT: They patrol their territory in pairs. I believe the igneous  rock components in the fur of this species are the result of  volcanic activity in its habitat.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0059_2793
TEXT: Snaps at its foes with fangs cloaked in blazing flame. Despite its  bulk, it deftly feints every which way, leading opponents on a  deceptively merry chase as it all but dances around them.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0157_2786
TEXT: Said to purify lost, forsaken souls with its flames and guide them  to the afterlife. I believe its form has been influenced by the  energy of the sacred mountain towering at Hisui’s center.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0211_2788
TEXT: Fishers detest this troublesome Pokémon because it sprays  poison from its spines, getting it everywhere. A different form  of Qwilfish lives in other regions.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0215_2794
TEXT: Its sturdy, curved claws are ideal for traversing precipitous cliffs.  From the tips of these claws drips a venom that infiltrates the  nerves of any prey caught in Sneasel’s grasp.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0503_2787
TEXT: Hard of heart and deft of blade, this rare form of Samurott is  a product of the Pokémon’s evolution in the region of Hisui. Its  turbulent blows crash into foes like ceaseless pounding waves.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0549_2789
TEXT: I suspect that its well-developed legs are the result of a life  spent on mountains covered in deep snow. The scent it exudes  from its flower crown heartens those in proximity.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0570_2796
TEXT: A once-departed soul, returned to life in Hisui. Derives power  from resentment, which rises as energy atop its head and takes  on the forms of foes. In this way, Zorua vents lingering malice.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0571_2797
TEXT: With its disheveled white fur, it looks like an embodiment of  death. Heedless of its own safety, Zoroark attacks its nemeses  with a bitter energy so intense, it lacerates Zoroark’s own body.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0628_2798
TEXT: Screaming a bloodcurdling battle cry, this huge and ferocious  bird Pokémon goes out on the hunt. It blasts lakes with shock  waves, then scoops up any prey that float to the water’s surface.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0705_2790
TEXT: A creature given to melancholy. I suspect its metallic shell  developed as a result of the mucus on its skin reacting with  the iron in Hisui’s water.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0706_2791
TEXT: Able to freely control the hardness of its metallic shell.  It loathes solitude and is extremely clingy—it will fume and  run riot if those dearest to it ever leave its side.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0713_2795
TEXT: The armor of ice covering its lower jaw puts steel to shame and  can shatter rocks with ease. This Pokémon barrels along steep  mountain paths, cleaving through the deep snow.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0724_2785
TEXT: The air stored inside the rachises of Decidueye’s feathers  insulates the Pokémon against Hisui’s extreme cold. This is  firm proof that evolution can be influenced by environment.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0899
TEXT: The black orbs shine with an uncanny light when the Pokémon is  erecting invisible barriers. The fur shed from its beard retains  heat well and is a highly useful material for winter clothing.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0900
TEXT: A violent creature that fells towering trees with its crude axes  and shields itself with hard stone. If one should chance upon  this Pokémon in the wilds, one’s only recourse is to flee.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0901
TEXT: I believe it was Hisui’s swampy terrain that gave Ursaluna its  burly physique and newfound capacity to manipulate peat  at will.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0902
TEXT: Clads itself in the souls of comrades that perished before  fulfilling their goals of journeying upstream. No other species  throughout all Hisui’s rivers is Basculegion’s equal.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0903
TEXT: Because of Sneasler’s virulent poison and daunting physical  prowess, no other species could hope to best it on the frozen  highlands. Preferring solitude, this species does not form packs.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0904
TEXT: Its lancelike spikes and savage temperament have earned it the  nickname “sea fiend.” It slurps up poison to nourish itself.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0905
TEXT: When it flies to this land from across the sea, the bitter winter  comes to an end. According to legend, this Pokémon’s love  gives rise to the budding of fresh life across Hisui.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_0_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%! Wonderful to see you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_0_1
TEXT: You may know this already, but some Pokémon have different forms depending on the region they appear in, like Geodude. In most places, Geodude are described as being very similar to rocks—so much so that many Trainers mistake them for boulders.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_0_2
TEXT: Uniquely, the Geodude found in Alola are Rock- and Electric-type, while the Geodude found in Kanto are Rock- and Ground-type. Fascinating, don't you think?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_0_3
TEXT: You know, if you accidentally step on an Alolan Geodude, you'll hear a crunching sound and feel a shock ripple through your entire body.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_0_4
TEXT: I’d read about this phenomenon some time ago, but I was, er, “lucky” enough to experience it myself earlier today. Suffice it to say it left me feeling electrified!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_0_5
TEXT: Why don’t you head out to find some Alolan Geodude for yourself? Just make sure to watch your step!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! I see you had no trouble finding Alolan Geodude.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_1_1
TEXT: When Alolan Geodude evolves into Alolan Graveler, it becomes even more impressive. Alolan Graveler’s food of choice is a mineral called dravite. After eating it, crystals form inside the Pokémon, rising to the surface in some parts of its body.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_1_2
TEXT: Oh! And this fact’s my favorite: When two Alolan Graveler clash, it fills the surrounding area with flashes of light and sound. People call it the “fireworks of the earth”!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_1_3
TEXT: You know, I’d really like to see Alolan Graveler for myself. Think you can help me out, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_2_0
TEXT: Well done! That’s a mighty Alolan Graveler you’ve got there.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_2_1
TEXT: I’d love to see those “fireworks of the earth” for myself, but...maybe later. And much farther from my lab.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_2_2
TEXT: In any case! While you were away, I continued with some field research of my own. I saw the most curious thing—an Alolan Geodude flying through the air!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_2_3
TEXT: I suspect it was the work of Alolan Golem, the Evolution of Alolan Graveler. Alolan Golem can shoot large rocks that are charged with electricity. However, because it can’t fire boulders at a rapid pace, it’s been known to grab nearby Geodude and fire them instead.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_2_4
TEXT: Can you do some research to help me understand what I saw?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_3_0
TEXT: Ah, you’re back—and with an Alolan Golem!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_3_1
TEXT: Alolan Golem are known to be grumpy and stubborn. If you upset them, they discharge electricity from the surface of their bodies and let out a growl that sounds like thunder.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_3_2
TEXT: Between that and their penchant for launching Geodude in lieu of boulders, we’d best be careful around Alolan Golem.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_3_3
TEXT: You have an incredible knack for befriending Pokémon, though, so I’m sure you’ll be the best of pals in no time!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_3_4
TEXT: Thanks for assisting me with my research today, %PLAYERNAME%. It always “rocks” to have your help! Heh heh... See you next time!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_0_0
TEXT: It appears their aggression is primarily fueled by necessity...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_0_1
TEXT: Ah! Greetings again, Pokémon Trainer. You have found me mid-observation. An astounding amount of these Pokémon are present today—Deino, is it?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_0_2
TEXT: Bereft of sight, their first instinct is to bite. I have experienced this firsthand—but do not fret. The pain was minimal.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_0_3
TEXT: This world is replete with unique Pokémon. Though I wish to study them all, today’s focus will be on Deino alone.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_0_4
TEXT: May I borrow some moments from you, Pokémon Trainer? I would welcome your expertise in this endeavor.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_1_0
TEXT: Thank you for your assistance, Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_1_1
TEXT: Deino tackle and bite at their surroundings. Even in darkness, they find novel ways to navigate the world...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_1_2
TEXT: ......

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_1_3
TEXT: Ahem. Do you think the Deino seek anything in particular? Sustenance, perhaps?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_1_4
TEXT: I see. It is normal in your world to feed Berries to Pokémon when attempting to catch them. Hmm... Deino may not be able to see, but I wonder how well they can smell and taste.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_1_5
TEXT: I wish to investigate the acuity of these senses by seeing how Deino respond to Berries. Will you assist me, Pokémon Trainer?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_2_0
TEXT: How dee, Pokémon Trainer. I have observed you sending Gifts to your friends affixed with charming decorations. Stuckums, is it? No? Ah—stickers. What is the function of these adornments?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_2_1
TEXT: I see... So they are primarily decorative, but can also communicate certain sentiments. There seems to be much comradery among the Pokémon Trainers in this world.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_2_2
TEXT: Deino may bite and tackle each other, but perhaps what appears aggressive and unfriendly is simply an interaction we do not understand. Putting yourself in the mind of a Pokémon can illuminate new perspectives, do you not think?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_2_3
TEXT: Hm? Your Professor Willow would also share his observations of the Pokémon you encountered? I hope you find my musings equally helpful.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_2_4
TEXT: If I may muse further: I am eager to observe Deino’s Evolution. Its physical changes may inform its behavior.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_3_0
TEXT: Astounding. You have shown me yet another wonder of this world, Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_3_1
TEXT: I did not anticipate Deino would gain an additional head when it evolved to Zweilous—though I cannot discern if either head can see.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_3_2
TEXT: The two heads appear quite quarrelsome—particularly regarding food. Ah—be calm! There are Berries for all mouths!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_3_3
TEXT: Zweilous could learn much from the friendship you and I share. Perhaps it will do so as you travel together.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_3_4
TEXT: I have learned recently that Zweilous can evolve into a Pokémon called Hydreigon. Will it gain yet more heads? Will it trade quarrels for kindness?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_3_5
TEXT: Thank you for accompanying me in my investigation today, Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_3_6
TEXT: I presumed the mysteries of the Ultra Wormholes and Ultra Beasts would be my primary focus here—but the Pokémon of your world hold many mysteries of their own.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_0_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%! Good to see you. How’ve you been? Rested and relaxed, I hope?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_0_1
TEXT: I’ve been full of energy since I saw Tapu Fini. And as I thought more about that encounter, I realized that over these past few months, we’ve been seeing quite a few Pokémon that were first found in Alola.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_0_2
TEXT: And you—you’ve even been lucky enough to see all four of Alola’s island guardians!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_0_3
TEXT: I can’t say I’m completely free of envy, but I’m glad you were able to have those experiences.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_0_4
TEXT: After all, we professors owe much of our learning to adventurous Trainers like yourself!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_0_5
TEXT: I wonder if our friendship would be as fruitful if our roles were reversed... I’d sure like to hope so! Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_0_6
TEXT: Keep exploring, %PLAYERNAME%. You never know what you might find!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! Look at that—you’ve caught all of Alola’s first partner Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_1_1
TEXT: They make for quite the iconic trio.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_1_2
TEXT: Let’s continue our Alola-inspired research today!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_1_3
TEXT: Which of Alola’s islands piques your interest the most, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2a_0
TEXT: So you’re interested in Melemele Island, eh? No surprise there—it’s one of my favorites as well.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2a_1
TEXT: Though perhaps that isn’t saying much... They’re all my favorites, really! Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2a_2
TEXT: As we’ve discussed, Melemele Island is where many Trainers in Alola begin the region’s island challenge.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2a_3
TEXT: There’s even a Trainers’ School there, where aspiring young Trainers can make friends and study up on all things Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2a_4
TEXT: In the spirit of Melemele Island, why don’t you go meet some new Pokémon and send some Gifts to your friends?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2b_0
TEXT: So you’re interested in Akala Island, eh? No surprise there—it’s one of my favorites as well.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2b_1
TEXT: Though perhaps that isn’t saying much... They’re all my favorites, really! Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2b_2
TEXT: As I mentioned before, Akala Island offers a variety of geological features, including a volcano, fishing spots, and even waterfalls!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2b_3
TEXT: I like to take a stroll when my mind gets mired in a problem, and it sounds like Akala Island would be a great place for that.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2b_4
TEXT: In that spirit, why don’t you take a stroll yourself? I’ll be here when you get back.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2c_0
TEXT: So you’re interested in Ula’Ula Island, eh? No surprise there—it’s one of my favorites as well.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2c_1
TEXT: Though perhaps that isn’t saying much... They’re all my favorites, really! Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2c_2
TEXT: As we’ve discussed, Ula’Ula Island is home to Mount Lanakila, the highest peak in all of Alola! But did you know the summit of Mount Lanakila also houses Alola’s very own Pokémon League?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2c_3
TEXT: It’s a place many Trainers aspire to reach, and doing so requires forging powerful bonds with Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2c_4
TEXT: In that spirit, why don’t you head out and find some new Pokémon partners, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2d_0
TEXT: So you’re interested in Poni Island, eh? No surprise there—it’s one of my favorites as well.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2d_1
TEXT: Though perhaps that isn’t saying much... They’re all my favorites, really! Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2d_2
TEXT: Did you know that Poni Island is home to the Battle Tree, Alola’s preeminent battle facility? Strong Trainers gather there to test their teams against each other.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2d_3
TEXT: I’ve heard you can even meet some Pokémon League Champions there on occasion! The things I could learn from them...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2d_4
TEXT: In the spirit of Poni Island—and as an act of public service—why don’t you test your battling skills against Team GO Rocket, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_3_1
TEXT: I don’t know about you, but I’ve had a great time getting to learn more about Alola, its Pokémon, and even its guardian deities.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_3_2
TEXT: If there’s one thing I love about Pokémon, it’s that there’s always something new to learn!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_3_3
TEXT: But to be honest with you, I was hoping we’d have a better idea by now of what attracted Alola’s guardian deities here.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_3_4
TEXT: They usually spend their time protecting Alola, so what could’ve spurred them to come here?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_3_5
TEXT: Could it be that they sensed something dangerous nearby that may threaten Alola? It would have to be something extraordinary—maybe even beyond our current understanding of Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_3_6
TEXT: Another daunting yet fascinating question for us to tackle together, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_3_7
TEXT: Whatever comes next, I know the two of us will overcome it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_3_8
TEXT: For now, continue your island research. I’ll keep trying to spot the guardian deities!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_3_9

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_battle_narrative_section_2_0

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_battle_narrative_section_2_1
TEXT: I really hope Shaymin hasn’t found itself in any trouble!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_battle_narrative_section_2_2

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_battle_narrative_section_3_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! We’re off to a great start already.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_battle_narrative_section_3_1

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_battle_narrative_section_3_2
TEXT: How intensely do you think we’ll need to focus our efforts today?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_battle_narrative_section_3_3
TEXT: That sounds good to me.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_battle_narrative_section_3_4
TEXT: Something else just occurred to me. Do you think Team GO Rocket will try to capture Shaymin?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_battle_narrative_section_3_5
TEXT: The thought of something happening to that sweet little Pokémon is almost too much to bear.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_battle_narrative_section_3_6
TEXT: Well, now that your team’s powered up, we can stop Team GO Rocket before they even get started. Let’s get out there and scare them off, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_battle_narrative_section_4_0
TEXT: Welcome back! Thanks for taking care of those Team GO Rocket members.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_battle_narrative_section_4_1
TEXT: Now that the area’s safe, we can really focus on our search for Shaymin.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_battle_narrative_section_4_2
TEXT: After meeting with the team leaders, I’ve learned that Shaymin sightings are happening around the world! Since we can’t be everywhere all at once, let’s start the search right here, where we are.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_battle_narrative_section_4_3
TEXT: Hm? You didn’t know the team leaders were assisting us? But of course!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_battle_narrative_section_4_4
TEXT: The team leaders are a curious bunch, and dutiful, too. They’re more than happy to help investigate the mysteries of Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_battle_narrative_section_4_5
TEXT: My current theory is that Shaymin will appear wherever Trainers are feeling thankful. With that in mind, why don’t you and your Buddy Pokémon try challenging a raid?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_battle_narrative_section_4_6
TEXT: Perhaps Shaymin will sense the gratitude you feel for your Pokémon and the other Trainers battling at your side.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_battle_narrative_section_5_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! How’d it go?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_battle_narrative_section_5_1
TEXT: No sign of Shaymin yet, eh? Not to worry. What fun would life be if we got everything on the first try?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_battle_narrative_section_5_2
TEXT: I’ll check in with the team leaders to see if they have any new intel. In the meantime, let’s think of other ways we can encourage Shaymin to appear.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_battle_narrative_section_5_3
TEXT: What if you try battling some other Trainers? Perhaps Shaymin will sense the bonds of gratitude between you and your Pokémon team. Give it a try, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_catch_narrative_section_2_0
TEXT: Before we get started, let’s take a moment to appreciate our Pokémon pals.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_catch_narrative_section_2_1
TEXT: It’s always exciting to meet new Pokémon, but it’s important to make time for the ones that have supported us all along. After all, we’d be lost without them!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_catch_narrative_section_2_2
TEXT: Much like I’d be lost without your unwavering support. Thanks as always, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_catch_narrative_section_2_3
TEXT: Now, why don’t you spend some time with your Buddy Pokémon?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_catch_narrative_section_3_0

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_catch_narrative_section_3_2
TEXT: Hm? You didn’t know the team leaders were assisting us? But of course! They’re a curious bunch, and dutiful, too. They’re more than happy to help investigate the mysteries of Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_catch_narrative_section_3_3
TEXT: I wonder if Shaymin is out getting to know the nearby Pokémon. Try catching a few and see if you can spot Shaymin!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_catch_narrative_section_4_1
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! How’d it go?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_catch_narrative_section_4_2
TEXT: No sign of Shaymin yet, eh? Well, that’s understandable. Mythical Pokémon aren’t known to be easy to find, after all!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_catch_narrative_section_4_3
TEXT: I appreciate you entertaining my hypothesis, though. Perhaps we can try luring Shaymin out with some Pinap Berries next? That would certainly work for me... Haha!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_catch_narrative_section_5_0
TEXT: Welcome back! No Shaymin yet, eh? Not to worry. What fun would life be if everything came easily?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_catch_narrative_section_5_1

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_catch_narrative_section_5_2

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_explore_narrative_section_2_0

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_explore_narrative_section_2_2

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_explore_narrative_section_4_0
TEXT: How’d it go, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_explore_narrative_section_4_1

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_explore_narrative_section_4_2

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_explore_narrative_section_4_3

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_explore_narrative_section_5_2

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_intro_narrative_section_1

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_intro_narrative_section_2
TEXT: The flowers on Shaymin’s body are said to burst into bloom when Shaymin is lovingly hugged and senses gratitude. Believe me, it’s not every day you see Shaymin around!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_intro_narrative_section_3
TEXT: I wonder if Shaymin’s appearance is somehow related to the island guardians...

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_intro_narrative_section_4
TEXT: Or... What if Shaymin’s appeared in response to how thankful I am for all your help lately! Shaymin is known as the Gratitude Pokémon, after all.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_intro_narrative_section_5
TEXT: I’m also thankful that you’re here today to enjoy the celebrations. You’ve more than earned it!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_intro_narrative_section_6

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_outro_narrative_section_2

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_outro_narrative_section_3

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_outro_narrative_section_4
TEXT: I want to hear all about how you found Shaymin, but first—have you noticed what’s appeared in the sky?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_outro_narrative_section_5
TEXT: Those gaping anomalies appear reminiscent of Hoopa’s rings, but also quite different. A bit like...black holes, perhaps? No—wormholes? What could be on the other side, I wonder? Is this why Alola’s island guardians have been appearing?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_outro_narrative_section_6
TEXT: My mind is buzzing with all the possibilities! Though, I think we should tackle this tomorrow. Today’s been plenty exciting.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_outro_narrative_section_7

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_outro_narrative_section_8

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_pre_choice_narrative_section_1

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_pre_choice_narrative_section_3

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_1_0

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_1_1

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_1_10

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_1_11

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_1_12
TEXT: Tell me all about your world, Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_1_13
TEXT: Together, perhaps we can expose why the Ultra Wormholes have materialized in your world and mitigate the anomalies that result.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_1_2
TEXT: It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance. I am Rhi of the GO Ultra Recon Squad.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_1_3
TEXT: You are a...Pokémon Trainer, is it? I am familiar with the concept.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_1_4
TEXT: I apologize if I appear awkward. You are the first human I’ve met in this world.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_1_5
TEXT: Do you see that hole in the sky? That is called an Ultra Wormhole, a tear in space that leads to a world very different from yours.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_1_6
TEXT: In fact, I’ve traveled through that wormhole myself, in order to research its appearance and assist with any resulting anomalies occurring in your world.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_1_7
TEXT: Hm? You have a concern?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_1_8
TEXT: I see. This “Professor Willow” failed to appear before you, is it? I’m unfamiliar with any such individual, but I understand the concern that arises when a companion is missing.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_1_9
TEXT: I will assist you in your search. In return, however, I would ask a favor.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_2_0
TEXT: Wah tee sup, Pokémon Trainer? Hmm... That feels incorrect.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_2_1
TEXT: Thank you for your assistance thus far. Shall we turn our attention to other objectives?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_2_10
TEXT: Until again, Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_2_2
TEXT: First, we must find out what caused the Ultra Wormholes to appear in this world.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_2_3
TEXT: Second, we must keep watch for anything that may travel through them.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_2_4
TEXT: And third, we must find your missing Willow friend.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_2_5
TEXT: But before all of that, a question: what are those large, towering structures spread throughout the area? They seem to sometimes be blue or red or yellow, and they’re far larger than what you said are “PokéStops.”

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_2_6
TEXT: “Gyms,” is it? And Pokémon Trainers gather there to challenge powerful Pokémon in “Raid Battles”? Fascinating.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_2_7
TEXT: Tell me everything you know about these Raid Battles, Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_2_8
TEXT: They seem to serve as nexus between powerful creatures and humans.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_2_9
TEXT: If it is acceptable to you, I would like to start by focusing our efforts there.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_3_0
TEXT: Thank you for shining a light on the concept of Raid Battles, Pokémon Trainer. In return, I will confide in you what I know about the Ultra Wormholes.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_3_1
TEXT: Ultra Wormholes are portals into Ultra Space.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_3_10
TEXT: But worry not, Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_3_11
TEXT: If that person was the Willow professor you’re searching for, the GO Ultra Recon Squad will no doubt come to their aid. Such is our purpose.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_3_12
TEXT: In the between time, I will remain here to provide assistance and illuminate any truths I can.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_3_13
TEXT: Let us continue to help each other, Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_3_2
TEXT: These dimensional passageways allow creatures known as Ultra Beasts to spill into worlds they don’t belong—and they are fiercely strong.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_3_3
TEXT: Ultra Beasts are similar to the creatures you call Pokémon—but to your eyes, I imagine they might appear...somewhat different than what you’re accustomed.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_3_4
TEXT: As you have likely observed, more and more Ultra Beasts are appearing around you.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_3_5
TEXT: The one in your world now is known as UB-01 Symbiont. Certain humans also call it Nihilego.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_3_6
TEXT: It is a Rock- and Poison-type Ultra Beast that is thought to produce a strong neurotoxin. It appears to be a parasite that lives by feeding on people and Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_3_7
TEXT: I’d like to subdue it before it causes trouble for anyone in this world. Can I beg your help in this undertaking?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_3_8
TEXT: I have no experience in Pokémon battles. Where I come from, Pokémon are shared.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_3_9
TEXT: Furthermore, there are indications that someone from this world was sucked into an Ultra Wormhole. If that is true, that person could be in tremendous danger.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_4_0
TEXT: To what are you up, Pokémon Trainer? That...that’s not it, is it? *sigh* I see you have caught many Ground-type Pokémon. May I ask why?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_4_1
TEXT: They’re particularly effective against Rock- and Poison-type Pokémon like Nihilego, is it? I see. Your forethought is impressive.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_4_2
TEXT: I have decided it would be prudent of me to explore and better familiarize myself with the surrounding area. Would you like to accompany?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_4_3

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_4_4

TEXT: There is still much for me to learn about this world, but it has been quite exciting thus far.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_4_6
TEXT: Come, Pokémon Trainer. Let us see what we can discover together.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_5_0
TEXT: A question, Pokémon Trainer—who are those people with the large red Rs on their clothes?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_5_1
TEXT: Judging by their dour expressions, I do not believe they’re friends of yours.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_5_2
TEXT: Team GO Rocket, is it? Curious...

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_5_3
TEXT: Their presence unnerves me.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_5_4
TEXT: If they intend to cause us problems, may I rely on you?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_6_0
TEXT: Your skill in battle is effervescent, Pokémon Trainer! Your aptitude assures me that Nihilego can be safely subdued.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_6_1
TEXT: May we now observe the Gyms where Nihilego has been appearing? Participating in Raid Battles may prove illuminating as well.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_6_2
TEXT: Hm? Ultra Beasts aren’t the only creatures you’ve encountered of late that are far from their homes?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_6_3
TEXT: I see... The Island Guardians of Alola, is it? Perhaps they sensed that the Ultra Wormholes would appear and came to assess how much of a threat they may pose to Alola.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_6_4
TEXT: The Alola region... I’ve heard tell of its shine. But we haven’t time for my wistfulness. Let us embark, Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_7_0
TEXT: Shall we pause, Pokémon Trainer?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_7_1
TEXT: This is my first time in the field with another by my side. I apologize—I’ve yet to grow accustomed to the nuances of this dynamic.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_7_2
TEXT: How do you typically enjoy your rest in this world?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_7_3
TEXT: I see... Spending time with your Pokémon and friends, hatching Eggs, and other such endeavors, is it?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_7_4
TEXT: I am enchanted by these “Incubators” that you place Eggs within.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_7_5
TEXT: They seem an amazing feat of human science. Would you provide me a demonstration?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_7_6
TEXT: Perhaps if we appear relaxed, Nihilego may respond in kind.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_7_7
TEXT: Though there is always a chance it may try to feast upon you—but I will alert you if I notice such behavior in action.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_7_8
TEXT: To think I may soon witness Nihilego being captured in a Poké Ball...

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_8_0
TEXT: You were unfazed by that confrontation with Nihilego.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_8_1
TEXT: You seem unafraid of the unknown. It’s an admirable trait.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_8_2
TEXT: Do you think Nihilego felt disoriented and alone when it found itself in an unfamiliar world? I feel a kinship with it in that way...

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_8_3
TEXT: I am lucky to have met a nice human so quickly. I hope Nihilego may also consider itself lucky to have encountered such a kind and accomplished Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_8_4
TEXT: In the end, Ultra Beasts are powerful creatures—and not easily controlled.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_8_5
TEXT: Once they have arrived in a world, there is little left I can do...

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_8_6
TEXT: And yet you have managed to take it in gently as if it were any other Pokémon. Selfishly, I wish for a closer look at Nihilego in this state. Do you have a way to observe it safely?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_8_7
TEXT: A “snapshot,” is it? What a delight.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_8_8
TEXT: Seeing Nihilego in this lucent world, I might even say it is...beautiful?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_9_0
TEXT: Your world is almost blindingly bright—and more verdant than I’ve ever experienced. I do hope you and your people take care to preserve its splendor.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_9_1
TEXT: Were I to exist in such a sparkling world, I would devote my power to its protection.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_9_10
TEXT: Would you mind if we continued our work as partners, Pokémon Trainer?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_9_11
TEXT: Our goals easily entwine. Together, we can accomplish and learn much.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_9_12
TEXT: You agree? Excellent. Now, our first course of action should be—

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_9_13
TEXT: Wait. What are these flowers blooming about us? Is this what Pokémon can do? Yours is truly a dazzling world...

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_9_2
TEXT: Judging by your recent actions, you seem to feel similar. You captured Nihilego, derailing disaster while seeking a solution to this world’s new dilemma.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_9_3
TEXT: And regarding your Willow... I recently discovered this juice-stained coat near an Ultra Wormhole. There’s no way to be certain, but it seems highly probable that your Willow is somewhere in Ultra Space.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_9_4
TEXT: But worry not, Pokémon Trainer. I will work with you to rescue him. You have done me many favors—it is only fair.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_9_5
TEXT: If this man is anything like you’ve described, I have no doubt he’ll be well in the end.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_9_6
TEXT: So long as Ultra Wormholes remain open here, we have a chance of his safe return—but Ultra Beasts may also continue to spill into this world.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_9_7
TEXT: For now, I’ll see what else I can do to assist you.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_9_8
TEXT: The GO Ultra Recon Squad normally works in pairs, and your presence has helped me understand why that is.
