TEXT: Er...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_0_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%! Wonderful to see you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_0_1
TEXT: You may know this already, but some Pokémon have different forms depending on the region they appear in, like Geodude. In most places, Geodude are described as being very similar to rocks—so much so that many Trainers mistake them for boulders.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_0_2
TEXT: Uniquely, the Geodude found in Alola are Rock- and Electric-type, while the Geodude found in Kanto are Rock- and Ground-type. Fascinating, don't you think?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_0_3
TEXT: You know, if you accidentally step on an Alolan Geodude, you'll hear a crunching sound and feel a shock ripple through your entire body.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_0_4
TEXT: I’d read about this phenomenon some time ago, but I was, er, “lucky” enough to experience it myself earlier today. Suffice it to say it left me feeling electrified!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_0_5
TEXT: Why don’t you head out to find some Alolan Geodude for yourself? Just make sure to watch your step!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! I see you had no trouble finding Alolan Geodude.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_1_1
TEXT: When Alolan Geodude evolves into Alolan Graveler, it becomes even more impressive. Alolan Graveler’s food of choice is a mineral called dravite. After eating it, crystals form inside the Pokémon, rising to the surface in some parts of its body.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_1_2
TEXT: Oh! And this fact’s my favorite: When two Alolan Graveler clash, it fills the surrounding area with flashes of light and sound. People call it the “fireworks of the earth”!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_1_3
TEXT: You know, I’d really like to see Alolan Graveler for myself. Think you can help me out, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_2_0
TEXT: Well done! That’s a mighty Alolan Graveler you’ve got there.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_2_1
TEXT: I’d love to see those “fireworks of the earth” for myself, but...maybe later. And much farther from my lab.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_2_2
TEXT: In any case! While you were away, I continued with some field research of my own. I saw the most curious thing—an Alolan Geodude flying through the air!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_2_3
TEXT: I suspect it was the work of Alolan Golem, the Evolution of Alolan Graveler. Alolan Golem can shoot large rocks that are charged with electricity. However, because it can’t fire boulders at a rapid pace, it’s been known to grab nearby Geodude and fire them instead.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_2_4
TEXT: Can you do some research to help me understand what I saw?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_3_0
TEXT: Ah, you’re back—and with an Alolan Golem!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_3_1
TEXT: Alolan Golem are known to be grumpy and stubborn. If you upset them, they discharge electricity from the surface of their bodies and let out a growl that sounds like thunder.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_3_2
TEXT: Between that and their penchant for launching Geodude in lieu of boulders, we’d best be careful around Alolan Golem.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_3_3
TEXT: You have an incredible knack for befriending Pokémon, though, so I’m sure you’ll be the best of pals in no time!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_3_4
TEXT: Thanks for assisting me with my research today, %PLAYERNAME%. It always “rocks” to have your help! Heh heh... See you next time!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_0_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%! Good to see you. How’ve you been? Rested and relaxed, I hope?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_0_1
TEXT: I’ve been full of energy since I saw Tapu Fini. And as I thought more about that encounter, I realized that over these past few months, we’ve been seeing quite a few Pokémon that were first found in Alola.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_0_2
TEXT: And you—you’ve even been lucky enough to see all four of Alola’s island guardians!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_0_3
TEXT: I can’t say I’m completely free of envy, but I’m glad you were able to have those experiences.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_0_4
TEXT: After all, we professors owe much of our learning to adventurous Trainers like yourself!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_0_5

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_0_6

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_1_0

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_1_1

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_1_2

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_1_3
TEXT: Which of Alola’s islands piques your interest the most, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2a_0

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2a_1
TEXT: Though perhaps that isn’t saying much... They’re all my favorites, really! Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2a_2
TEXT: As we’ve discussed, Melemele Island is where many Trainers in Alola begin the region’s island challenge.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2a_3

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2b_1
TEXT: Though perhaps that isn’t saying much... They’re all my favorites, really! Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2b_2
TEXT: As I mentioned before, Akala Island offers a variety of geological features, including a volcano, fishing spots, and even waterfalls!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2b_3
TEXT: I like to take a stroll when my mind gets mired in a problem, and it sounds like Akala Island would be a great place for that.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2b_4

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2c_0

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2c_2
TEXT: As we’ve discussed, Ula’Ula Island is home to Mount Lanakila, the highest peak in all of Alola! But did you know the summit of Mount Lanakila also houses Alola’s very own Pokémon League?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2c_3
TEXT: It’s a place many Trainers aspire to reach, and doing so requires forging powerful bonds with Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2c_4

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2d_0

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2d_1
TEXT: Though perhaps that isn’t saying much... They’re all my favorites, really! Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2d_2
TEXT: Did you know that Poni Island is home to the Battle Tree, Alola’s preeminent battle facility? Strong Trainers gather there to test their teams against each other.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2d_3
TEXT: I’ve heard you can even meet some Pokémon League Champions there on occasion! The things I could learn from them...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2d_4
TEXT: In the spirit of Poni Island—and as an act of public service—why don’t you test your battling skills against Team GO Rocket, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_3_1

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_3_2
TEXT: If there’s one thing I love about Pokémon, it’s that there’s always something new to learn!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_3_3
TEXT: But to be honest with you, I was hoping we’d have a better idea by now of what attracted Alola’s guardian deities here.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_3_4
TEXT: They usually spend their time protecting Alola, so what could’ve spurred them to come here?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_3_5
TEXT: Could it be that they sensed something dangerous nearby that may threaten Alola? It would have to be something extraordinary—maybe even beyond our current understanding of Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_3_6
TEXT: Another daunting yet fascinating question for us to tackle together, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_3_7
TEXT: Whatever comes next, I know the two of us will overcome it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_3_8

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_3_9

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_3c_0

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_3d_0

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_0_0

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_0_1

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_0_2
TEXT: I still have a few loose ends to wrap up, though.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_0_3
TEXT: While I finish my preparations, how about you take a quick survey of the area and see what Pokémon are out and about today?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_0_4
TEXT: I’ll be ready by the time you’re back.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1_0
TEXT: Ah, good—you’re back. I’ve just finished getting everything ready.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1_1
TEXT: Have you tried to Mega Evolve a Pokémon lately?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1_2
TEXT: Something about Mega Evolution caught my attention recently, so I was hoping you could help me investigate.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1_3
TEXT: Let’s take a closer look at Mega Evolution, from beginning to end.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1_4
TEXT: First, let’s choose which of these Pokémon you’d like to be the star of our research, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1_5
TEXT: Once we’re done, our understanding of Mega Evolution will be second to none.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1a_0
TEXT: So, you’ve chosen Venusaur, the Seed Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1a_1
TEXT: Venusaur absorbs solar energy as nutrition. By spreading the broad petals of its flower and catching the sun’s rays, it fills its body with power.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1a_2
TEXT: While I fetch Venusaur, how about you go out and catch a few Pokémon as a warm-up. Don’t forget to power them up, too.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1a_3
TEXT: You’ll have an even more formidable team by your side in no time!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1b_0
TEXT: So, you’ve chosen Charizard, the Flame Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1b_1
TEXT: Its bond with its Trainer is the source of its power. It boasts speed and maneuverability greater than that of a jet fighter.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1b_2
TEXT: While I fetch Charizard, how about you go out and catch a few Pokémon as a warm-up. Don’t forget to power them up, too.

TEXT: You’ll have an even more formidable team by your side in no time!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1c_0
TEXT: So, you’ve chosen Blastoise, the Shellfish Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1c_1
TEXT: The jets of water it spouts from the rocket cannons on its shell can punch through thick steel.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1c_2
TEXT: While I fetch Blastoise, how about you go out and catch a few Pokémon as a warm-up. Don’t forget to power them up, too.

TEXT: You’ll have an even more formidable team by your side in no time!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_2a_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! Now that we’re fully warmed up, let’s tuck into our research on Mega Evolution.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_2a_1
TEXT: Some theorize that a strong bond between a Trainer and a Pokémon is the key to Mega Evolution. We’ve also seen that Mega Energy can play a role.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_2a_2
TEXT: However, I noticed recently that if you Mega Evolve your Pokémon once using Mega Energy, you won’t need to use Mega Energy to Mega Evolve that Pokémon again.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_2a_3
TEXT: Let’s Mega Evolve Venusaur and see if that’s true for ourselves, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_3a_1

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_0_1
TEXT: I’m feeling especially refreshed today, as if a pleasant island breeze was following me. Maybe it’s the freshly squeezed Pinap Juice I had for breakfast?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_3_2
TEXT: I wonder why Tapu Koko is here. Tapu Koko is said to be a Pokémon brimming with curiosity—but, naturally, island guardians tend to stay on their respective islands. The fact that one of them is here may mean something is amiss...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_3_4
TEXT: Do you think we’ll get a chance to meet the other island guardians, %PLAYERNAME%? Wouldn’t that be something.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_0_0
TEXT: Oh, %PLAYERNAME%! Great to see you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_0_1
TEXT: Your timing is impeccable. Because you know what? I’ve had enough!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_0_2
TEXT: That’s right—I’ve had enough of waiting to see a guardian deity. Everyone but me has managed to glimpse one out of pure serendipity, so I’ve decided to be proactive and embark on a search for Tapu Fini!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_0_3
TEXT: Do you think you could lend me a hand? With you involved, I think my chance of success will skyrocket.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_0_4
TEXT: Tapu Fini is the guardian deity of Poni Island in the Alola region.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_0_5
TEXT: Terrible calamities sometimes befall those who recklessly approach Tapu Fini, so I’m going to think very carefully about how we can successfully—and safely—track it down.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_0_6
TEXT: In the meantime, can you see what Team GO Rocket is up to? I’d like to avoid any complications in our search.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_1_1
TEXT: I’ve been busy researching Tapu Fini. My sources say that it can manipulate water, and it lives deep within a thick fog.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_1_2
TEXT: With that in mind, I’d hazard a guess that we’ll have the most luck uncovering Tapu Fini’s whereabouts if we look in places where other Water-type Pokémon are appearing.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_1_3
TEXT: I’ll start by visiting every foggy lake I can find. I can hear Blanche’s water safety spiel already...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_1_4
TEXT: But, personally speaking, a bit of risk is worth it if I finally get to see an island guardian with my own eyes! You remember to be careful, too, okay?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_1_5
TEXT: Now, let’s get back out there!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_2_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%! Can you believe it?!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_2_1
TEXT: I was knee-deep in the last lake I thought to check—shoes soggy, Dewpider on all sides—when I finally, FINALLY, saw Tapu Fini!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_2_2
TEXT: I’d love to tell you more about it, but I need to scribble down all the details in my journal while they’re fresh in my mind.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_2_3
TEXT: You should head out and see if you can catch a glimpse of Tapu Fini yourself!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_3_0
TEXT: Phew! Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%. How’d you fare?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_3_1
TEXT: You saw Tapu Fini as well?! That’s fantastic!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_3_2
TEXT: Now you’ve seen all four of Alola’s guardian deities. And I’ve seen...all of one.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_3_3
TEXT: That’s... Well, it’s one more than I’d seen before, isn’t it!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_3_4
TEXT: Just have to stay positive. No use feeling jealous of others’ good fortune...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_3_5
TEXT: Now that we know all the island guardians are nearby, we should look into why they’ve appeared here.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_3_6
TEXT: Were the cause some unsavory act on our part, I think they would have confronted us directly by now—but instead, we’ve been the ones tracking them down.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_3_7
TEXT: It’s certainly possible their motives have nothing to do with us. Though I have to assume they’re investigating the area for a reason.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_3_8
TEXT: But what could that reason be? I suppose all we can do for now is wait and see what happens.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_1_4
TEXT: When their skin gets wrinkled from moisture, they head for volcanoes and lie flat on a spot with a lot of geothermal heat to dry themselves out.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_0_0
TEXT: *yawn* Hello, %PLAYERNAME%... You’ll have to forgive my appearance, I was up late last night studying some nearby Rowlet. For as sleepy as they can be during the day, they sure perk right up at night!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_0_1
TEXT: Maybe it’d help me relax if I had a soft, cute Pokémon to hug... Like Stufful!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_0_2
TEXT: Stufful has an adorable appearance, but it hates to be hugged or touched in any way. Which is a shame because I’ve heard its fur is a delight to pet!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_0_3
TEXT: I wonder if I’ll ever get the chance to snuggle one—for science, of course! Maybe you could bring me a Stufful, %PLAYERNAME%? Just to look at!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_1_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, you’re back! And you’ve brought a Stufful with you! It looks so soft and fluffy...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_1_1
TEXT: Er-hem! Despite their looks, Stufful are incredibly dangerous Pokémon. A touch from anyone except a known friend sends Stufful into a surging frenzy!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_1_2
TEXT: For both our sakes, maybe we’d better befriend it before we try to cuddle—I mean, continue our research, don’t you think? Why not try feeding Stufful a Berry or two, %PLAYERNAME%. Perhaps we can get closer to it that way.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_2_0
TEXT: Your Stufful seems friendlier already, %PLAYERNAME%! Speaking of friendly, have you heard that its Evolution—Bewear—has the habit of hugging its companions?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_2_1
TEXT: Once Bewear accepts you as a friend, it tries to show its affection with a hug. But letting it do that is dangerous—it could easily shatter your bones!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_2_2
TEXT: Many Trainers have left this world after their spines were squashed by its hug...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_2_3
TEXT: While I don’t recommend you go hugging a Bewear anytime soon, there isn’t any harm in trying to meet one! Why don’t you evolve Stufful, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_3_0
TEXT: What a strong-looking Bewear you’ve come back with, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_3_1
TEXT: What’s that? You say I look a bit more frazzled than usual? Well...I may have tried to pet Stufful while you were away, and its flailing sent me flying so far someone could’ve mistaken me for a bird Pokémon. Haha—ow...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_3_2
TEXT: On the bright side, I did get to both pet Stufful and experience its strength firsthand! Come to think of it, I have a colleague studying Pokémon moves who’d love to hear all about this...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_3_3
TEXT: I hope you’ve had more luck bonding with your new Stufful and Bewear companions, %PLAYERNAME%. I think I’m going to bow out and grab an ice pack...or six. Thanks for all your help today! Take care, I’ll be in touch!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_battle_narrative_section_2_1
TEXT: I really hope Shaymin hasn’t found itself in any trouble!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_battle_narrative_section_2_2

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_battle_narrative_section_3_0

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_battle_narrative_section_3_1

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_battle_narrative_section_3_2
TEXT: How intensely do you think we’ll need to focus our efforts today?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_battle_narrative_section_3_3
TEXT: That sounds good to me.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_battle_narrative_section_3_4
TEXT: Something else just occurred to me. Do you think Team GO Rocket will try to capture Shaymin?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_battle_narrative_section_3_5
TEXT: The thought of something happening to that sweet little Pokémon is almost too much to bear.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_battle_narrative_section_3_6
TEXT: Well, now that your team’s powered up, we can stop Team GO Rocket before they even get started. Let’s get out there and scare them off, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_battle_narrative_section_4_0
TEXT: Welcome back! Thanks for taking care of those Team GO Rocket members.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_battle_narrative_section_4_1
TEXT: Now that the area’s safe, we can really focus on our search for Shaymin.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_battle_narrative_section_4_2
TEXT: After meeting with the team leaders, I’ve learned that Shaymin sightings are happening around the world! Since we can’t be everywhere all at once, let’s start the search right here, where we are.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_battle_narrative_section_4_3
TEXT: Hm? You didn’t know the team leaders were assisting us? But of course!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_battle_narrative_section_4_4
TEXT: The team leaders are a curious bunch, and dutiful, too. They’re more than happy to help investigate the mysteries of Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_battle_narrative_section_4_5
TEXT: My current theory is that Shaymin will appear wherever Trainers are feeling thankful. With that in mind, why don’t you and your Buddy Pokémon try challenging a raid?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_battle_narrative_section_4_6
TEXT: Perhaps Shaymin will sense the gratitude you feel for your Pokémon and the other Trainers battling at your side.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_battle_narrative_section_5_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! How’d it go?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_battle_narrative_section_5_1
TEXT: No sign of Shaymin yet, eh? Not to worry. What fun would life be if we got everything on the first try?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_battle_narrative_section_5_2
TEXT: I’ll check in with the team leaders to see if they have any new intel. In the meantime, let’s think of other ways we can encourage Shaymin to appear.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_battle_narrative_section_5_3
TEXT: What if you try battling some other Trainers? Perhaps Shaymin will sense the bonds of gratitude between you and your Pokémon team. Give it a try, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_catch_narrative_section_2_0
TEXT: Before we get started, let’s take a moment to appreciate our Pokémon pals.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_catch_narrative_section_2_1
TEXT: It’s always exciting to meet new Pokémon, but it’s important to make time for the ones that have supported us all along. After all, we’d be lost without them!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_catch_narrative_section_2_2
TEXT: Much like I’d be lost without your unwavering support. Thanks as always, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_catch_narrative_section_2_3
TEXT: Now, why don’t you spend some time with your Buddy Pokémon?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_catch_narrative_section_3_0
TEXT: And I hope you had a pleasant time with your Buddy Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_catch_narrative_section_3_2
TEXT: Hm? You didn’t know the team leaders were assisting us? But of course! They’re a curious bunch, and dutiful, too. They’re more than happy to help investigate the mysteries of Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_catch_narrative_section_3_3
TEXT: I wonder if Shaymin is out getting to know the nearby Pokémon. Try catching a few and see if you can spot Shaymin!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_catch_narrative_section_4_1
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! How’d it go?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_catch_narrative_section_4_2
TEXT: No sign of Shaymin yet, eh? Well, that’s understandable. Mythical Pokémon aren’t known to be easy to find, after all!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_catch_narrative_section_4_3
TEXT: I appreciate you entertaining my hypothesis, though. Perhaps we can try luring Shaymin out with some Pinap Berries next? That would certainly work for me... Haha!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_catch_narrative_section_5_0
TEXT: Welcome back! No Shaymin yet, eh? Not to worry. What fun would life be if everything came easily?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_catch_narrative_section_5_1

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_catch_narrative_section_5_2

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_explore_narrative_section_2_0

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_explore_narrative_section_2_2

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_explore_narrative_section_4_0
TEXT: How’d it go, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_explore_narrative_section_4_1

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_explore_narrative_section_4_3

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_explore_narrative_section_5_2

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_intro_narrative_section_1
TEXT: This year’s festivities are already off to an incredible start—I’m receiving reports that the Mythical Pokémon Shaymin has been sighted nearby!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_intro_narrative_section_2
TEXT: The flowers on Shaymin’s body are said to burst into bloom when Shaymin is lovingly hugged and senses gratitude. Believe me, it’s not every day you see Shaymin around!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_intro_narrative_section_3
TEXT: I wonder if Shaymin’s appearance is somehow related to the island guardians...

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_intro_narrative_section_4
TEXT: Or... What if Shaymin’s appeared in response to how thankful I am for all your help lately! Shaymin is known as the Gratitude Pokémon, after all.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_intro_narrative_section_5
TEXT: I’m also thankful that you’re here today to enjoy the celebrations. You’ve more than earned it!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_intro_narrative_section_6

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_outro_narrative_section_0

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_outro_narrative_section_1
TEXT: Once you’re better friends, I hope you’ll hug it so we can see its flowers burst into bloom!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_outro_narrative_section_2
TEXT: As always, thanks for helping me with today’s research! Your contributions are truly invaluable.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_outro_narrative_section_3
TEXT: I’d like to give you a hug myself—but I spilled some Pinap Juice on myself earlier, so I think I’ll keep my stickiness to myself.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_outro_narrative_section_4
TEXT: I want to hear all about how you found Shaymin, but first—have you noticed what’s appeared in the sky?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_outro_narrative_section_5
TEXT: Those gaping anomalies appear reminiscent of Hoopa’s rings, but also quite different. A bit like...black holes, perhaps? No—wormholes? What could be on the other side, I wonder? Is this why Alola’s island guardians have been appearing?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_outro_narrative_section_6
TEXT: My mind is buzzing with all the possibilities! Though, I think we should tackle this tomorrow. Today’s been plenty exciting.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_outro_narrative_section_7
TEXT: I can’t wait to see what tomorrow holds.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_outro_narrative_section_8

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_pre_choice_narrative_section_1

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_pre_choice_narrative_section_2

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_pre_choice_narrative_section_3

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_1_0
TEXT: Ah—hello.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_1_1
TEXT: Or, hmm... Would “what is up” be an acceptable greeting in this circumstance? I have been told the humans of this world are fond of such parlance.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_1_10
TEXT: This world is mysterious. Would you assist me in expanding my knowledge of it?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_1_11
TEXT: Thank you. I am fortunate to have found someone so kind.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_1_12
TEXT: Tell me all about your world, Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_1_13
TEXT: Together, perhaps we can expose why the Ultra Wormholes have materialized in your world and mitigate the anomalies that result.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_1_2
TEXT: It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance. I am Rhi of the GO Ultra Recon Squad.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_1_3
TEXT: You are a...Pokémon Trainer, is it? I am familiar with the concept.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_1_4
TEXT: I apologize if I appear awkward. You are the first human I’ve met in this world.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_1_5
TEXT: Do you see that hole in the sky? That is called an Ultra Wormhole, a tear in space that leads to a world very different from yours.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_1_6
TEXT: In fact, I’ve traveled through that wormhole myself, in order to research its appearance and assist with any resulting anomalies occurring in your world.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_1_7
TEXT: Hm? You have a concern?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_1_8
TEXT: I see. This “Professor Willow” failed to appear before you, is it? I’m unfamiliar with any such individual, but I understand the concern that arises when a companion is missing.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_1_9
TEXT: I will assist you in your search. In return, however, I would ask a favor.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_2_0
TEXT: Wah tee sup, Pokémon Trainer? Hmm... That feels incorrect.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_2_1
TEXT: Thank you for your assistance thus far. Shall we turn our attention to other objectives?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_2_10
TEXT: Until again, Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_2_2
TEXT: First, we must find out what caused the Ultra Wormholes to appear in this world.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_2_3
TEXT: Second, we must keep watch for anything that may travel through them.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_2_4
TEXT: And third, we must find your missing Willow friend.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_2_5
TEXT: But before all of that, a question: what are those large, towering structures spread throughout the area? They seem to sometimes be blue or red or yellow, and they’re far larger than what you said are “PokéStops.”

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_2_6
TEXT: “Gyms,” is it? And Pokémon Trainers gather there to challenge powerful Pokémon in “Raid Battles”? Fascinating.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_2_7
TEXT: Tell me everything you know about these Raid Battles, Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_2_8
TEXT: They seem to serve as nexus between powerful creatures and humans.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_2_9
TEXT: If it is acceptable to you, I would like to start by focusing our efforts there.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_3_0
TEXT: Thank you for shining a light on the concept of Raid Battles, Pokémon Trainer. In return, I will confide in you what I know about the Ultra Wormholes.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_3_1
TEXT: Ultra Wormholes are portals into Ultra Space.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_3_10
TEXT: But worry not, Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_3_11
TEXT: If that person was the Willow professor you’re searching for, the GO Ultra Recon Squad will no doubt come to their aid. Such is our purpose.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_3_12
TEXT: In the between time, I will remain here to provide assistance and illuminate any truths I can.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_3_13
TEXT: Let us continue to help each other, Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_3_2
TEXT: These dimensional passageways allow creatures known as Ultra Beasts to spill into worlds they don’t belong—and they are fiercely strong.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_3_3
TEXT: Ultra Beasts are similar to the creatures you call Pokémon—but to your eyes, I imagine they might appear...somewhat different than what you’re accustomed.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_3_4
TEXT: As you have likely observed, more and more Ultra Beasts are appearing around you.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_3_5
TEXT: The one in your world now is known as UB-01 Symbiont. Certain humans also call it Nihilego.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_3_6
TEXT: It is a Rock- and Poison-type Ultra Beast that is thought to produce a strong neurotoxin. It appears to be a parasite that lives by feeding on people and Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_3_7
TEXT: I’d like to subdue it before it causes trouble for anyone in this world. Can I beg your help in this undertaking?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_3_8
TEXT: I have no experience in Pokémon battles. Where I come from, Pokémon are shared.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_3_9
TEXT: Furthermore, there are indications that someone from this world was sucked into an Ultra Wormhole. If that is true, that person could be in tremendous danger.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_4_0
TEXT: To what are you up, Pokémon Trainer? That...that’s not it, is it? *sigh* I see you have caught many Ground-type Pokémon. May I ask why?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_4_1
TEXT: They’re particularly effective against Rock- and Poison-type Pokémon like Nihilego, is it? I see. Your forethought is impressive.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_4_2
TEXT: I have decided it would be prudent of me to explore and better familiarize myself with the surrounding area. Would you like to accompany?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_4_3
TEXT: We can tell each other more about our worlds as we go.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_4_4
TEXT: I am once again thankful to have acquainted myself with someone so cordial.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_4_5
TEXT: There is still much for me to learn about this world, but it has been quite exciting thus far.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_4_6
TEXT: Come, Pokémon Trainer. Let us see what we can discover together.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_5_0
TEXT: A question, Pokémon Trainer—who are those people with the large red Rs on their clothes?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_5_1
TEXT: Judging by their dour expressions, I do not believe they’re friends of yours.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_5_2
TEXT: Team GO Rocket, is it? Curious...

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_5_3
TEXT: Their presence unnerves me.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_5_4
TEXT: If they intend to cause us problems, may I rely on you?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_6_0
TEXT: Your skill in battle is effervescent, Pokémon Trainer! Your aptitude assures me that Nihilego can be safely subdued.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_6_1
TEXT: May we now observe the Gyms where Nihilego has been appearing? Participating in Raid Battles may prove illuminating as well.

TEXT: Hm? Ultra Beasts aren’t the only creatures you’ve encountered of late that are far from their homes?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_6_3
TEXT: I see... The Island Guardians of Alola, is it? Perhaps they sensed that the Ultra Wormholes would appear and came to assess how much of a threat they may pose to Alola.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_6_4
TEXT: The Alola region... I’ve heard tell of its shine. But we haven’t time for my wistfulness. Let us embark, Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_7_0
TEXT: Shall we pause, Pokémon Trainer?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_7_1
TEXT: This is my first time in the field with another by my side. I apologize—I’ve yet to grow accustomed to the nuances of this dynamic.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_7_2
TEXT: How do you typically enjoy your rest in this world?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_7_3
TEXT: I see... Spending time with your Pokémon and friends, hatching Eggs, and other such endeavors, is it?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_7_4
TEXT: I am enchanted by these “Incubators” that you place Eggs within.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_7_5
TEXT: They seem an amazing feat of human science. Would you provide me a demonstration?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_7_6
TEXT: Perhaps if we appear relaxed, Nihilego may respond in kind.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_7_7
TEXT: Though there is always a chance it may try to feast upon you—but I will alert you if I notice such behavior in action.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_7_8
TEXT: To think I may soon witness Nihilego being captured in a Poké Ball...

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_8_0
TEXT: You were unfazed by that confrontation with Nihilego.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_8_1
TEXT: You seem unafraid of the unknown. It’s an admirable trait.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_8_2
TEXT: Do you think Nihilego felt disoriented and alone when it found itself in an unfamiliar world? I feel a kinship with it in that way...

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_8_3
TEXT: I am lucky to have met a nice human so quickly. I hope Nihilego may also consider itself lucky to have encountered such a kind and accomplished Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_8_4
TEXT: In the end, Ultra Beasts are powerful creatures—and not easily controlled.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_8_5
TEXT: Once they have arrived in a world, there is little left I can do...

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_8_6
TEXT: And yet you have managed to take it in gently as if it were any other Pokémon. Selfishly, I wish for a closer look at Nihilego in this state. Do you have a way to observe it safely?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_8_7
TEXT: A “snapshot,” is it? What a delight.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_8_8
TEXT: Seeing Nihilego in this lucent world, I might even say it is...beautiful?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_9_0
TEXT: Your world is almost blindingly bright—and more verdant than I’ve ever experienced. I do hope you and your people take care to preserve its splendor.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_9_1
TEXT: Were I to exist in such a sparkling world, I would devote my power to its protection.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_9_10
TEXT: Would you mind if we continued our work as partners, Pokémon Trainer?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_9_11
TEXT: Our goals easily entwine. Together, we can accomplish and learn much.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_9_12
TEXT: You agree? Excellent. Now, our first course of action should be—

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_9_13
TEXT: Wait. What are these flowers blooming about us? Is this what Pokémon can do? Yours is truly a dazzling world...

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_9_2
TEXT: Judging by your recent actions, you seem to feel similar. You captured Nihilego, derailing disaster while seeking a solution to this world’s new dilemma.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_9_3
TEXT: And regarding your Willow... I recently discovered this juice-stained coat near an Ultra Wormhole. There’s no way to be certain, but it seems highly probable that your Willow is somewhere in Ultra Space.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_9_4
TEXT: But worry not, Pokémon Trainer. I will work with you to rescue him. You have done me many favors—it is only fair.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_9_5
TEXT: If this man is anything like you’ve described, I have no doubt he’ll be well in the end.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_9_6
TEXT: So long as Ultra Wormholes remain open here, we have a chance of his safe return—but Ultra Beasts may also continue to spill into this world.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_9_7
TEXT: For now, I’ll see what else I can do to assist you.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_9_8
