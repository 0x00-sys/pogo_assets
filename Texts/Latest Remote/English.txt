RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_0_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%! Excellent timing.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_0_1
TEXT: I just made a tremendously exciting discovery!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_0_2
TEXT: Earlier today, I was exploring a nearby cave to collect some samples when I noticed a peculiar warmth along one of the walls.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_0_3
TEXT: Suddenly, something jumped out and tried to bite me!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_0_4
TEXT: I quickly realized I had stumbled upon a nest of Gible, the Land Shark Pokémon. Gible is known to react to anything that moves, so sometimes it leaps out and chomps passersby.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_0_5
TEXT: I know it just wanted a nibble, but that’s a nibble too much in my book!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_0_6
TEXT: Anyway, it’s not every day you run into a gaggle of Gible. Do you think you could head out and do some research on their appearance here?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_1_1
TEXT: While you were out tracking down the Land Shark Pokémon, I took a closer look at the cave I was telling you about earlier.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_1_2
TEXT: I was reminded of an interesting tidbit about Gible. It nests inside small, horizontal holes in cave walls warmed by geothermal heat.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_1_3
TEXT: Gible seems to love warm places, and that cave certainly fits the bill.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_1_4
TEXT: We’ve learned a lot about this Dragon- and Ground-type Pokémon, but there’s always more to discover!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_1_5
TEXT: When you’re ready, how about you try evolving your Gible into Gabite?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_2_0
TEXT: Nice job evolving your Gible into Gabite, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_2_1
TEXT: Gabite is known as the Cave Pokémon, and it loves sparkly things.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_2_2
TEXT: It emits ultrasonic waves from protrusions on either side of its head to probe pitch-dark caves.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_2_3
TEXT: What a useful ability! Maybe it could help me avoid bumping into lab equipment in the middle of the night...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_2_4
TEXT: We’ve seen Gible and Gabite, but there’s still one more Evolution we need to document. Come see me when you’ve evolved your Gabite, Trainer!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_3_0
TEXT: Ah! Fantastic work, %PLAYERNAME%. That’s an admirable Garchomp!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_3_1
TEXT: Known as the Mach Pokémon, its body is covered in fine scales that reduce drag, enabling it to fly at high speeds.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_3_2
TEXT: Those scales don’t just reduce wind resistance—their sharp edges also cause injury to any opponent that touches them. Pretty spiffy, eh?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_3_3
TEXT: I think you’ll find Garchomp to be a powerful companion on your adventures.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_3_4
TEXT: And I can’t wait to see how your relationship develops along the way!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_3_5
TEXT: Thanks for all your help today, Trainer. I hope you had a fin-tastic time!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_3_6
TEXT: Now, let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_0_0
TEXT: Hello there, %PLAYERNAME%! I was just taking a moment to admire the weather here. Blue skies abound, with the fluffiest of clouds floating by.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_0_1
TEXT: I’d love to just kick back and enjoy the tranquility of it all, but I’ve observed some of the clouds moving rather...strangely.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_0_2
TEXT: Believe it or not, I believe some of them are actually flapping—yes, like birds!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_0_3
TEXT: The first few times I saw it, I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me, but as the motions grew more frequent, I began to suspect a Pokémon was involved. 

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_0_4
TEXT: Mind going on a little jaunt to see what you can discover?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, Trainer! What have you discovered?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_1_1
TEXT: Ah—Swablu! The Cotton Bird Pokémon. Hmm... It’s all beginning to make sense.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_1_2
TEXT: Swablu’s cotton-like wings are so fluffy and white that, alongside their sky-blue bodies, Swablu can be easily mistaken for clouds in the sky.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_1_3
TEXT: At least until you catch them flapping, eh? Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_1_4
TEXT: Swablu apparently love to sit on people’s heads. They look like fluffy hats!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_1_5
TEXT: Ah, and there it goes! Right on your head. Good timing, Swablu!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_1_6
TEXT: Fond as they are of their human perches, Swablu will take flight right away if their wings get dirty. Cleanliness begets comfort, after all.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_1_7
TEXT: A fascinating Pokémon through and through, don’t you think?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_1_8
