RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_finale_1_1_1
TEXT: Pokémon Trainer! I have a positive update to share.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_finale_1_1_2
TEXT: After analyzing the data we collected from the Ultra Wormholes, I have located—and retrieved—Professor Willow from Ultra Space.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_finale_1_1_3
TEXT: His return would not have been possible without your exhaustive efforts.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_finale_1_1_4
TEXT: I do not doubt you are eager to speak with him, but he requires rest before your reunion.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_finale_1_1_5
TEXT: Following that, I would appreciate your assistance with another matter.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_finale_1_1_6
TEXT: UB-01 Symbiont and UB-02 Beauty—that is, Nihilego and Pheromosa—have once again returned to this world.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_finale_1_1_7
TEXT: I need not emphasize what dangers they pose.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_finale_1_1_8
TEXT: Additionally, new signals indicate that other Ultra Beasts may soon follow.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_finale_1_1_9
TEXT: But first, your professor. You and I can reconvene after you two have spoken.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_finale_1_2_1
TEXT: ... ... ...
%PLAYERNAME%? Is...that you?
How long has it been? It’s good to see you. I’ve had the most amazing adventure!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_finale_1_2_2
TEXT: There I was, pondering the mysteries of the island guardians—and moping a little at my misfortune, I must admit—when a glowing portal appeared out of thin air!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_finale_1_2_3
TEXT: I couldn’t help wondering what was on the other side. My curiosity ignited, I weighed the risks, grabbed my gear, and jumped right in!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_finale_1_2_4
TEXT: The portal led to a completely different dimension—one traversed by unimaginably strange creatures...

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_finale_1_2_5
TEXT: I must tell you all about it! *yawn* But before I do, I could use a little nap. I promise I’ll spare no detail after I’ve slept...a few...
*snore*

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_finale_2_1_1
TEXT: Welcome back, Pokémon Trainer. I hope you had a pleasant reunion with your professor. Has he fallen asleep? Understandable.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_finale_2_1_2
TEXT: You and I can turn our attention to the Ultra Beasts while he recuperates.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_finale_2_1_3
TEXT: I have confirmed the reappearance of UB-02 Absorption, Buzzwole.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_finale_2_1_4
TEXT: Buzzwole’s propensity for displaying its robust musculature remains a mystery—is it mere self-satisfaction or some kind of threat?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_finale_2_1_5
TEXT: Its sturdy physique stands in contrast to Pheromosa’s lithe frame.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_finale_2_1_6
TEXT: Though neither should be underestimated.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_finale_2_1_7
TEXT: Since we cannot predict their behavior, I propose further observation. Have you all your necessary supplies?

RESOURCE ID: gofest_2022_finale_2_2_1
TEXT: A brilliant display, Pokémon Trainer. Before we continue, I have something for you.

RESOURCE ID: gofest_2022_finale_2_2_2
TEXT: Here—a small supply of Beast Balls.

RESOURCE ID: gofest_2022_finale_2_2_3
TEXT: Excuse me if I am repeating myself, but allow me a brief explanation.

RESOURCE ID: gofest_2022_finale_2_2_4
TEXT: Beast Balls were developed specifically to capture Ultra Beasts. Your assistance enabled me to fabricate them—I wish to help you as you have helped me.

RESOURCE ID: gofest_2022_finale_2_2_5
TEXT: I trust you will know the right time to use them. Now, let us continue our work.

RESOURCE ID: gofest_2022_finale_3_1_1
TEXT: Pokémon Trainer—I feel we are being watched. Could it be Team GO Rocket?

RESOURCE ID: gofest_2022_finale_3_1_2
TEXT: If they have been observing us, then do you believe they have plans that involve the Ultra Beasts?

RESOURCE ID: gofest_2022_finale_3_1_3
TEXT: This is a possibility we cannot ignore.

RESOURCE ID: gofest_2022_finale_3_1_4
TEXT: If only I could battle like you do... Until then, I must ask again for your aid.

RESOURCE ID: gofest_2022_finale_3_2_1
TEXT: Thank you for dispersing Team GO Rocket, Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: gofest_2022_finale_3_2_2
TEXT: I am relieved to know that they have been removed from the equation.

RESOURCE ID: gofest_2022_finale_3_2_3
TEXT: Your strength is further appreciated given this world’s most recent arrival—UB-03 Lighting. Xurkitree.

RESOURCE ID: gofest_2022_finale_3_2_4
TEXT: It has been known to raid power plants, presumably to energize itself with electricity.

RESOURCE ID: gofest_2022_finale_3_2_5
TEXT: It would be disastrous if Xurkitree depleted the power in this area.

RESOURCE ID: gofest_2022_finale_3_2_6
TEXT: Let us do what we can to prevent this catastrophe.

RESOURCE ID: gofest_2022_finale_4_1_1
TEXT: *yawn*
Oh, %PLAYERNAME%. Sorry I dozed off on you there—I hardly slept while I was away. Did anything interesting happen while I was gone?

RESOURCE ID: gofest_2022_finale_4_1_10
TEXT: You and your Pokémon should go check it out. I’ll be here. Just give me a...minute...
*snore*

RESOURCE ID: gofest_2022_finale_4_1_2
TEXT: ... ... ...
Ultra Wormholes?
Ultra Beasts?
BEAST BALLS?!

RESOURCE ID: gofest_2022_finale_4_1_3
TEXT: Incredible! I can always count on you to unearth amazing things. You even helped bring me home!

RESOURCE ID: gofest_2022_finale_4_1_4
TEXT: In that space, there were times when my memories would blur together—but I swear I could feel the light of our world, and everything would rush back.

RESOURCE ID: gofest_2022_finale_4_1_5
TEXT: No, it was more than a feeling. It was like I was surrounded by a protective presence—warm like the sun and calm like the moon.

RESOURCE ID: gofest_2022_finale_4_1_6
TEXT: Even so, I don’t know how I would have returned if you and your new friend hadn’t intervened.

RESOURCE ID: gofest_2022_finale_4_1_7
TEXT: I’m always thankful for you, but this time, you really saved me.

RESOURCE ID: gofest_2022_finale_4_1_8
TEXT: Why, I could just hug you, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: gofest_2022_finale_4_1_9
TEXT: Wait. Is there something in the sky? I’d investigate myself, but... *yawn* I suddenly feel like I lost a staring contest with a Hypno.

RESOURCE ID: gofest_2022_finale_4_2_1
TEXT: Pokémon Trainer, I saw you were able to speak with the professor. Is he in good health?

RESOURCE ID: gofest_2022_finale_4_2_2
TEXT: He felt something akin to light of the sun and moon, did he?

RESOURCE ID: gofest_2022_finale_4_2_3
TEXT: Interesting.

RESOURCE ID: gofest_2022_finale_4_2_4
TEXT: The important thing is that you and your Willow have been reunited. Endless musing is my proclivity, not yours.

RESOURCE ID: gofest_2022_finale_4_2_5
TEXT: Before we redirect our attention to the Ultra Beasts, I wish to take this opportunity to express what an excellent...erm...

RESOURCE ID: gofest_2022_finale_4_2_6
TEXT: I had intended to call you my “research partner,” but that feels insufficient. You are more than an assistant—you are my confidant.

RESOURCE ID: gofest_2022_finale_4_2_7
TEXT: Such a sterile title hardly suits a person as dazzling as you.

RESOURCE ID: gofest_2022_finale_4_2_8
TEXT: So thank you, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_dai_willow_part1_0_1

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_dai_willow_part1_0_2

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_dai_willow_part2_0_0

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_dai_willow_part2_0_1

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_dai_willow_part2_0_2

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_0_1
TEXT: As you know, I’ve been away for a while.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_0_2
TEXT: I’ve been thinking about how to shake off the doldrums. Then it hit me like a ton of bricks—Pokémon research! Specifically, I’d like to learn about Roggenrola.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_0_3
TEXT: Roggenrola were first discovered a hundred years ago in an earthquake fissure, but the dirt that makes up their bodies is even older!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_0_4
TEXT: A Pokémon made of earth is just the thing to get me feeling grounded again, don’t you think? Not that I need an excuse to study Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_0_5
TEXT: Could you unearth some Roggenrola for me, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_1_0
TEXT: Great job, %PLAYERNAME%! Let’s get a closer look at those Roggenrola.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_1_1
TEXT: Hm... Did you notice the hexagonal cavities on their bodies? Those are their ears, and deep inside is an energy core that makes Roggenrola slightly warm to the touch.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_1_2
TEXT: But don’t stick your hand inside the cavity—that’s a surefire way to get on their bad side, and fast!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_1_3
TEXT: Is that from firsthand experience, you ask? W-well, any researcher worth his salt has to take the occasional risk.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_1_4
TEXT: You know, when Roggenrola evolve into Boldore and their energy is too great to be contained, they grow orange crystals on their bodies hard enough to smash diamonds.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_1_5
TEXT: Doesn’t that sound like a sight, %PLAYERNAME%? Why don’t you help Roggenrola evolve so you can see for yourself?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_2_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! Your Boldore are looking great.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_2_1
TEXT: Their crystals—amazing! If only I had some diamonds to put that whole “smashing” thing to the proof.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_2_2
TEXT: Well, while we can’t conduct that particular experiment, I can still tell you more about Boldore.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_2_3
TEXT: Their crystals are actually masses of energy. Just one crystal fragment could provide enough fuel for a hundred dump trucks!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_2_4
TEXT: *sigh* Yet another theory we can’t test ourselves. But if you help Boldore evolve, I’ll tell you all about what they do with that power, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_3_0
TEXT: There you have it, %PLAYERNAME%—a Gigalith of your own. Those crystals are even bigger now!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_3_1
TEXT: When Gigalith’s orange crystals absorb solar energy, it’s magnified internally and fired from its mouth. It’s even capable of blowing away a mountain!

TEXT: Because of its hefty horsepower, Gigalith is a popular partner for construction workers.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_3_3
TEXT: I’m sure you and Gigalith will get along great too, seeing as you’re always out and about.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_3_4
TEXT: At any rate, thanks for helping me with my research today, %PLAYERNAME%. I’m feeling more like my old self already.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_3_5
TEXT: Let’s do this again soon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_0_0
TEXT: Hello, %PLAYERNAME%! It’s great to see you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_0_1
TEXT: I can’t thank you and Rhi enough for bringing me back from beyond the Ultra Wormhole. The two of you are quite the team!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_0_2
TEXT: As exhilarating as it was to explore a different dimension, it wasn’t without its challenges. Thoughts of home kept me calm—you, Meltan, the team leaders...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_0_3
TEXT: Maybe it was the sheer strength of those memories, but more than once it seemed almost like I was being surrounded by a protective presence—warm like the sun and calm like the moon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_0_4
TEXT: Who knows—maybe there really was something watching out for me! Our world can’t be the only one full of mysteries, after all.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_0_5
TEXT: Speaking of mysteries, I have a new one to share with you, %PLAYERNAME%. Since my return, a small, gaseous Pokémon I’ve never seen before has been hanging around my lab.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_0_6
TEXT: It seems friendly, but where did it come from?  Did it follow me from beyond the Ultra Wormhole? Could it be an Ultra Beast?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_0_7
TEXT: Considering that possibility, I think it would be best if you work with Rhi to raise this Pokémon. Naturally, I’ll be eager to hear anything you may learn in the process.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_1_0
TEXT: Greetings, Pokémon Trainer. With the Ultra Beasts presently at bay, now is an opportune moment to reflect on our time together thus far.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_1_1
TEXT: The Ultra Wormholes and the dangers they pose were my primary concerns upon arriving in this world. But now, I find myself equally invested in developing our relationship.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_1_2
TEXT: In light of our new rapport, perhaps it is time I reintroduced myself.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_1_3
TEXT: I am Rhi of the GO Ultra Recon Squad. It is a pleasure to be your friend, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_1_4
TEXT: Is there any objective I may assist you with today?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_1_5
TEXT: Your Professor Willow has asked us to rear and study a peculiar Pokémon, is it? Understood.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_1_6
TEXT: Ah. I have heard tales of such a Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_1_7
TEXT: Its gentle glow is impossible to mistake. I believe this Pokémon is called...Cosmog.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_1_8
TEXT: Come—let us show Cosmog the beauty of this world.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_2_0
TEXT: Hm? You wish to know more of Cosmog?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_2_1
TEXT: Some have said that in ages past, it was known as the child of the stars.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_2_2
TEXT: Beyond that, few details are known.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_2_3
TEXT: Perhaps you and I can shed some light on this peculiar Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_2_4
TEXT: Earning its trust seems like a logical first step.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_2_5
TEXT: Do you think Cosmog would feel closer to us if it were given a nickname?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_2_6
TEXT: Its visage reminds me of outer space... A nebula, perhaps.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_2_7
TEXT: But never mind my musings. I will leave the decision to you, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_2_8
TEXT: No matter the name, I am eager to learn more of Cosmog as we become better acquainted.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_0_0
TEXT: What peculiar coloring. Is it an aberration, or—?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_0_1
TEXT: Ah. You have arrived at an opportune moment, Pokémon Trainer. Might I seek your insight?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_0_2
TEXT: Zigzagoon are present in vast numbers today, but they are notably different from those I have observed previously.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_0_3
TEXT: Zigzagoon’s fur is normally earthy in hue, but these Zigzagoon are black and white.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_0_4
TEXT: Can you explain this?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_0_5
TEXT: I see... These Zigzagoon were first discovered in the Galar region.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_0_6
TEXT: So a single Pokémon species can develop differently based on its habitat? Fascinating.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_0_7
TEXT: I will spend today observing these Galarian Zigzagoon. Will you assist me, Pokémon Trainer?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_1_0
TEXT: How energetic these Galarian Zigzagoon are. Have you also observed how they dash in a zigzag pattern?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_1_1
TEXT: I hypothesized that this may increase its evasiveness—but when I tested it myself, I grew quite dizzy.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_1_2
TEXT: Fret not, Pokémon Trainer—no people or Pokémon were harmed during my experiment.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_1_3
TEXT: I am left wondering whether evolution would ease or encourage Galarian Zigzagoon’s frenetic movements. Perhaps we can discover that answer together.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_2_0
TEXT: Thank you for your assistance, Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_2_1
TEXT: I have concluded that Galarian Linoone’s disposition is no calmer than Galarian Zigzagoon’s. Indeed, its aggression appears to have increased.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_2_2
TEXT: Not long before your arrival, I observed a group of Galarian Linoone using their long tongues to taunt other Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_2_3
TEXT: They then hurled themselves at their enraged foes.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_2_4
TEXT: I am continuously enthralled by the ways Pokémon interact with each other.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_2_5
TEXT: Might Galarian Linoone itself be capable of evolution? More research is required.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_3_0
TEXT: Greetings, Pokémon Trainer. You have brought me...Obstagoon, is it?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_3_1
TEXT: Unlike Galarian Linoone, Obstagoon stands on two legs. I surmise this is to establish a threatening posture.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_3_2
TEXT: What’s more, I witnessed firsthand its ability to make staggering vocal outbursts.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_3_3
TEXT: My heart has yet to return to its normal rhythm.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_3_4
TEXT: I find it remarkable that the assertive Obstagoon was once a diminutive Galarian Zigzagoon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_3_5
TEXT: How must it feel to experience such profound transformation? I assume your Professor Willow would have some insight.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_3_6
TEXT: This has been a valuable learning experience. Thank you for your assistance today, Pokémon Trainer.
