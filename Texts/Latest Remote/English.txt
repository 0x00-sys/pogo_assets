RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_0_0
TEXT: Hello there, %PLAYERNAME%! I was just taking a moment to admire the weather here. Blue skies abound, with the fluffiest of clouds floating by.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_0_1
TEXT: I’d love to just kick back and enjoy the tranquility of it all, but I’ve observed some of the clouds moving rather...strangely.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_0_2
TEXT: Believe it or not, I believe some of them are actually flapping—yes, like birds!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_0_3
TEXT: The first few times I saw it, I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me, but as the motions grew more frequent, I began to suspect a Pokémon was involved. 

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_0_4
TEXT: Mind going on a little jaunt to see what you can discover?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, Trainer! What have you discovered?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_1_1
TEXT: Ah—Swablu! The Cotton Bird Pokémon. Hmm... It’s all beginning to make sense.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_1_2
TEXT: Swablu’s cotton-like wings are so fluffy and white that, alongside their sky-blue bodies, Swablu can be easily mistaken for clouds in the sky.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_1_3
TEXT: At least until you catch them flapping, eh? Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_1_4
TEXT: Swablu apparently love to sit on people’s heads. They look like fluffy hats!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_1_5
TEXT: Ah, and there it goes! Right on your head. Good timing, Swablu!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_1_6
TEXT: Fond as they are of their human perches, Swablu will take flight right away if their wings get dirty. Cleanliness begets comfort, after all.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_1_7
TEXT: A fascinating Pokémon through and through, don’t you think?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_1_8
TEXT: Evolving Swablu takes some effort, but I assure you—it’s well worth it! I’m sure a Trainer of your talent could gather the necessary Candy in no time.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_1_9
TEXT: I’d love to see its Evolution in person, so could you evolve your Swablu for me? Be sure to use Pinap Berries to earn even more Candy!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_2_0
TEXT: Incredible work, %PLAYERNAME%! Looks like you’ve been hard at work catching Swablu.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_2_1
TEXT: Evolving Swablu is truly an act of patience, isn’t it?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_2_2
TEXT: Patience is often called a virtue in a broad sense, but it really is an integral part of being a great Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_2_3
TEXT: As the saying goes: good things come to those who wait!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_2_4
TEXT: All your hard work will feel justified once you witness your darling Swablu evolve. Of that, you have my word!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_3_0
TEXT: Welcome back, Trainer! I see your efforts have paid off. Well done!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_3_1
TEXT: Swablu’s Evolution, Altaria, is called the Humming Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_3_2
TEXT: It’s known to wrap its wings around the people it’s bonded with—much like yours is doing with you now.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_3_3
TEXT: And humming all the while! You know, people say that Altaria’s humming could enrapture an entire audience with its beauty, and it’s not hard to see why.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_3_4
TEXT: Between Altaria’s song and your remarkable bond, I have to say I’m feeling quite moved!
