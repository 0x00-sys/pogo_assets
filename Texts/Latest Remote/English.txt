RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_1_1
TEXT: It is beautiful here. Dazzlingly so...

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_1_10
TEXT: Perhaps we should patrol the area to familiarize ourselves with its geography and identify any emerging irregularities.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_1_11
TEXT: I have also not forgotten about your missing professor.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_1_12
TEXT: Others have also expressed distress over his absence—specifically, a fiery woman with short brown hair.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_1_13
TEXT: She hypothesized that participating in Pokémon battles could shed some light on your companion’s whereabouts. As for how, I cannot say... But I trust her expertise on the matter.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_1_14
TEXT: Come, Pokémon Trainer. Let us begin our patrol.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_1_2
TEXT: Ah. You have once again caught me in a moment of reverie, Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_1_3
TEXT: I lost myself in the atmosphere around us.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_1_4
TEXT: I notice your fellows are gathering en masse.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_1_5
TEXT: Am I to understand this is typical for the Pokémon Trainers of your world?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_1_6
TEXT: So it is a festival. I see.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_1_7
TEXT: And since you are present, I assume you mean to participate.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_1_8
TEXT: Do enjoy, then. But I would caution you to stay alert.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_1_9
TEXT: If an Ultra Beast were to appear amid such a gathering, chaos would ensue.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_2_1
TEXT: This place has drawn a remarkable number of Pokémon—an astounding example of regional biodiversity.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_2_10
TEXT: After you, Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_2_2
TEXT: One even attempted to approach me. Your world’s Pokémon offer friendship so effortlessly.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_2_3
TEXT: If only the Ultra Beasts were as amiable...

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_2_4
TEXT: A shame. Moving on—you mentioned that you and Willow were pursuing the Pokémon Shaymin before his disappearance, correct?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_2_5
TEXT: I recently overheard another Pokémon Trainer say that “upon taking in the scent of a particular rare flower, Shaymin is enveloped in light, and its tiny body transforms.”

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_2_6
TEXT: An irradiant image. I wonder if this transformation is akin to Evolution or if it is something else entirely.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_2_7
TEXT: In a less eventful time, I would study Shaymin to see such a shine for myself.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_2_8
TEXT: But I must temper my enthusiasm. An Ultra Wormhole could appear at any moment.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_2_9
TEXT: We should continue our patrol.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_3_1
TEXT: Pokémon Trainer. Nihilego is no longer this world’s sole Ultra Beast.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_3_2
TEXT: I have just observed UB-02 Beauty—Pheromosa, to some humans—emerge from a freshly formed Ultra Wormhole.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_3_3
TEXT: Although it is a common organism in the world it calls home, it is a danger here.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_3_4
TEXT: It must not be allowed to wreak havoc.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_3_5
TEXT: Luckily, you and I have a history of contending with such situations.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_3_6
TEXT: Just be warned that this Ultra Beast is not easily subdued.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_3_7
TEXT: That is why I have prepared some Beast Balls for you.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_3_8
TEXT: They are a type of ball specifically designed to capture Ultra Beasts. I hope they prove useful.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_3_9
TEXT: Now, if you will attend to catching Pheromosa, I will focus on reconnaissance. Let us go, Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_4_1
TEXT: You impress me yet again, Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_4_10
TEXT: If you take snapshots of the unique locations in this area, we can scrutinize them together.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_4_2
TEXT: The ease with which you handle Ultra Beasts is enviable. It is a technique unfamiliar to me, and yet it comes to you naturally.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_4_3
TEXT: Even in the face of immense danger, I might add.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_4_4
TEXT: I am endlessly fascinated by you.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_4_5
TEXT: ... ... ...

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_4_6
TEXT: While you battled, I had a thought.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_4_7
TEXT: Your photographic observations—can they be used in other ways, perhaps?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_4_8
TEXT: For example: if you were to take snapshots of the surrounding areas, do you think that might help us identify anomalies we’d otherwise miss if we relied only on our eyes?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_4_9
TEXT: It is “worth a shoot,” at any rate.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_5_1
TEXT: Thank you for your diligence, Pokémon Trainer. I will take your snapshots for further study.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_5_10
TEXT: We will surely find him. I will prioritize the study of your snapshots and conduct further reconnaissance on my own time—it is the least I can do in return for all that you have done for me.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_5_11
TEXT: Until I uncover a clue, let us turn our attention back to the subject of food.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_5_12
TEXT: Would it benefit us to feed Pheromosa, I wonder?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_5_13
TEXT: Perhaps the positive properties of this world’s Poffins affect Ultra Beasts as well.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_5_14
TEXT: However, Pheromosa seems reticent to engage—almost as if this world disagrees with its notion of cleanliness.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_5_15
TEXT: An experiment, then: let us place a Poffin on the ground so we may observe its reaction.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_5_16
TEXT: From a distance.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_5_2
TEXT: What is that in your other hand—a Poffin? Are you hungry?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_5_3
TEXT: Hm. We have been walking for a while.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_5_4
TEXT: Let us rest, then.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_5_5
TEXT: Perhaps your Pokémon is also in need of nourishment.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_5_6
TEXT: And while we are on the subject: what distinguishes Pokémon food from human food?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_5_7
TEXT: Your professor would have such answers? I should have known—his juice-stained coat speaks of an affinity for Berries.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_5_8
TEXT: Do you think he—

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_5_9
TEXT: Apologies. It was tactless of me to speak of Willow when you are anxious about his safety.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_6_1
TEXT: What an oddly enjoyable endeavor, Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_6_10
TEXT: The more we learn, the less there is to fear.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_6_11
TEXT: I suspect Willow feels much the sa—

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_6_12
TEXT: Wait. Another anomaly is approaching. It almost resembles the description you gave of the Pokémon Shaymin, and yet with marked differences...

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_6_2
TEXT: Your Pokémon are lucky to have such a reliable guardian.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_6_3
TEXT: I’m sure they are grateful. As am I.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_6_4
TEXT: This entire situation would have been troublesome for me to handle alone.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_6_5
TEXT: Our time together has taught me much.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_6_6
TEXT: While you were tending to your Pokémon, I detected a promising signal from within Ultra Space.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_6_7
TEXT: It is not much, but I believe it is connected to your professor.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_6_8
TEXT: I hope this provides you with some degree of solace.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_6_9
TEXT: Knowledge is the great illuminator.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_7_1
TEXT: So, I have seen Shaymin and its transformative light.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_7_10
TEXT: But enough talk. The light of your festival beckons.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_7_11
TEXT: Thank you for sharing this experience with me today.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_7_12
TEXT: Until again, Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_7_2
TEXT: And from within this light emerges another form.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_7_3
TEXT: What a resplendent revelation.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_7_4
TEXT: You said Shaymin is drawn to gratitude. Do you believe it was my own such feelings that brought it here?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_7_5
TEXT: I am flattered it deemed me worthy.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_7_6
TEXT: And I hope I may continue to be a worthy companion to you as well.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_7_7
TEXT: With UB-02 Beauty safely in your care and no other Ultra Beasts emerging, I will release you to partake in your festivities.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_7_8
TEXT: Meanwhile, I will resume my investigation into Willow’s whereabouts.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_7_9

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_sapporo_city_ub_1

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_sapporo_city_ub_2

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_sapporo_city_ub_3

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_sapporo_city_wrap_up_1

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_sapporo_city_wrap_up_2

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_sapporo_park_pokemon
TEXT: I have seen—let me consult my notes—Galarian Ponyta, Lapras, Makuhita, and Litwick...

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_1_1
TEXT: Good night, Pokémon Trainer. No—is it good morning now?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_1_10
TEXT: Others have also expressed distress over his absence.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_1_11
TEXT: Specifically, a man with spiked hair and an apparent affection for the color yellow.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_1_12
TEXT: He has been conducting reconnaissance and seeking clues to your professor’s whereabouts by speaking to Pokémon Trainers assembled at raids.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_1_13
TEXT: Perhaps we can also venture to Gyms as we attempt to locate the Ultra Wormhole. Those gathered may help direct our search.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_1_14
TEXT: Let us go, Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_1_2
TEXT: Temporal expressions aside, I am struck by our surroundings.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_1_3
TEXT: This is quite a bustling place.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_1_4
TEXT: Which makes my recent readings all the more distressing. I have detected signals that indicate the inevitable appearance of an Ultra Wormhole.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_1_5
TEXT: We must locate it and prepare for the emergence of another Ultra Beast.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_1_6
TEXT: Let us survey the city.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_1_7
TEXT: I have also not forgotten about your missing professor.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_2_1
TEXT: How brightly glass glistens when touched by the sun...

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_2_2
TEXT: Apologies. Even the mundane becomes novel in this abundant light.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_2_3
TEXT: But I digress. Have you seen any additional anomalies on your patrol?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_2_4
TEXT: In an area this large, I cannot pinpoint the exact location from which an Ultra Wormhole will originate.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_2_5
TEXT: We can only rely on our own visual surveillance.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_2_6
TEXT: I wonder if the items provided by your PokéStops might help us prepare for the Ultra Wormhole’s impending arrival.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_2_7
TEXT: It would befit us to gather as much aid as possible.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_3_1
TEXT: Pokémon Trainer. Indulge me in a moment of introspection.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_3_2
TEXT: To me, the humans here are exceedingly fortunate.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_3_3
TEXT: Even with all our technology, my home is not at all like this.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_3_4
TEXT: A world of darkness...

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_3_5
TEXT: Yet here, light spills from the smallest things—such as your Incubators and their Eggs.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_3_6
TEXT: If you can forgive another imposition, will you show me the effect of an Incubator once again?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_3_7
TEXT: I wish to see its light.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_3_8
TEXT: Thank you, Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_4_1
TEXT: Pokémon Trainer. I have located the Ultra Wormhole.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_4_10
TEXT:  I hope they prove useful.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_4_2
TEXT: The appearance of an Ultra Beast is imminent.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_4_3
TEXT: Fortunately, you and I have a history of contending with such situations.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_4_4
TEXT: My data indicates that the Ultra Beast most likely to appear is UB-02 Absorption.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_4_5
TEXT: Some humans call it Buzzwole. It seems to enjoy displaying its robust musculature.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_4_6

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_4_7

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_5_3
TEXT: Now, I have an update to share.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_5_4
TEXT: I detected an odd signal when Buzzwole emerged from the Ultra Wormhole.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_5_6
TEXT: Using it, I can better investigate where within Ultra Space your Professor Willow may be.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_5_7
TEXT: I will continue to do what I can to expedite his recovery.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_1_1
TEXT: Pokémon Trainer. Good...morning? Or is it the evening?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_1_10
TEXT: Perhaps we should both patrol the area to familiarize ourselves with its geography and identify any emerging irregularities.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_1_11
TEXT: Come, Pokémon Trainer. Let us begin.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_1_2
TEXT: I am still growing accustomed to the cycles of this world.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_1_3
TEXT: But enough about time—let us focus on space. Prior to your arrival, I was surveying the area for Ultra Wormholes.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_1_4
TEXT: Though I find myself getting lost in the atmosphere around us.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_1_5
TEXT: Trainers are gathering here en masse...

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_1_6
TEXT: Ah. So it’s a festival to celebrate the Pokémon Trainers of this world.

TEXT: One even attempted to approach me. Your world’s Pokémon offer friendship so effortlessly. If only the Ultra Beasts were as amiable.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_3_3
TEXT: I have seen—let me consult my notes—Lapras, Skorupi, Litwick, Rufflet...

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_3_4
TEXT: Even my idle time has been illuminating. I discovered that Litwick shines a light that absorbs the life energy of people and Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_3_5
TEXT: I noted this phenomenon from a distance.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_3_6
TEXT: Another benefit of your photographic observations. What else can be safely documented through them?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_3_7
TEXT: Taking snapshots of the unique locations in this area might answer this. It is “worth a shoot,” at any rate.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_4_1

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0058_2792
TEXT: They patrol their territory in pairs. I believe the igneous rock components in the fur of this species are the result of volcanic activity in its habitat.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0059_2793
TEXT: Snaps at its foes with fangs cloaked in blazing flame. Despite its bulk, it deftly feints every which way, leading opponents on a deceptively merry chase as it all but dances around them.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0144_2801
TEXT: Its feather-like blades are composed of psychic energy and can shear through thick iron sheets as if they were paper.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0145_2800
TEXT: When its feathers rub together, they produce a crackling sound like the zapping of electricity. That’s why this Pokémon is called Zapdos.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0146_2799
TEXT: This Pokémon’s sinister, flame-like aura will consume the spirit of any creature it hits. Victims become burned-out shadows of themselves.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0157_2786
TEXT: Said to purify lost, forsaken souls with its flames and guide them to the afterlife. I believe its form has been influenced by the energy of the sacred mountain towering at Hisui’s center.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0211_2788
TEXT: Fishers detest this troublesome Pokémon because it sprays poison from its spines, getting it everywhere. A different form of Qwilfish lives in other regions.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0215_2794
TEXT: Its sturdy, curved claws are ideal for traversing precipitous cliffs. From the tips of these claws drips a venom that infiltrates the nerves of any prey caught in Sneasel’s grasp.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0503_2787
TEXT: Hard of heart and deft of blade, this rare form of Samurott is a product of the Pokémon’s evolution in the region of Hisui. Its turbulent blows crash into foes like ceaseless pounding waves.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0549_2789
TEXT: I suspect that its well-developed legs are the result of a life spent on mountains covered in deep snow. The scent it exudes from its flower crown heartens those in proximity.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0570_2796
TEXT: A once-departed soul, returned to life in Hisui. Derives power from resentment, which rises as energy atop its head and takes on the forms of foes. In this way, Zorua vents lingering malice.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0571_2797
TEXT: With its disheveled white fur, it looks like an embodiment of death. Heedless of its own safety, Zoroark attacks its nemeses with a bitter energy so intense, it lacerates Zoroark’s own body.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0628_2798
TEXT: Screaming a bloodcurdling battle cry, this huge and ferocious bird Pokémon goes out on the hunt. It blasts lakes with shock waves, then scoops up any prey that float to the water’s surface.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0705_2790
TEXT: A creature given to melancholy. I suspect its metallic shell developed as a result of the mucus on its skin reacting with the iron in Hisui’s water.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0706_2791
TEXT: Able to freely control the hardness of its metallic shell. It loathes solitude and is extremely clingy—it will fume and run riot if those dearest to it ever leave its side.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0713_2795
TEXT: The armor of ice covering its lower jaw puts steel to shame and can shatter rocks with ease. This Pokémon barrels along steep mountain paths, cleaving through the deep snow.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0724_2785
TEXT: The air stored inside the rachises of Decidueye’s feathers insulates the Pokémon against Hisui’s extreme cold. This is firm proof that evolution can be influenced by environment.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0899
TEXT: The black orbs shine with an uncanny light when the Pokémon is erecting invisible barriers. The fur shed from its beard retains heat well and is a highly useful material for winter clothing.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0900
TEXT: A violent creature that fells towering trees with its crude axes and shields itself with hard stone. If one should chance upon this Pokémon in the wilds, one’s only recourse is to flee.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0901
TEXT: I believe it was Hisui’s swampy terrain that gave Ursaluna its burly physique and newfound capacity to manipulate peat at will.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0902
TEXT: Clads itself in the souls of comrades that perished before fulfilling their goals of journeying upstream. No other species throughout all Hisui’s rivers is Basculegion’s equal.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0903
TEXT: Because of Sneasler’s virulent poison and daunting physical prowess, no other species could hope to best it on the frozen highlands. Preferring solitude, this species does not form packs.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0904
TEXT: Its lancelike spikes and savage temperament have earned it the nickname “sea fiend.” It slurps up poison to nourish itself.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0905_2802
TEXT: When it flies to this land from across the sea, the bitter winter comes to an end. According to legend, this Pokémon’s love gives rise to the budding of fresh life across Hisui.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0905_2803
TEXT: A different guise from its feminine humanoid form. From the clouds, it descends upon those who treat any form of life with disrespect and metes out wrathful, ruthless punishment.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_dai_part1_0_2
TEXT: You have not seen this before either? I see.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_dai_part1_0_3
TEXT: Perhaps it is an entirely new invention.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_dai_part1_0_4

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_dai_part1_0_5

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_dai_part1_0_6
TEXT: Please give me some moments.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_dai_part2_0_0
TEXT: The notes were indeed enlightening, Pokémon Trainer. Your professor calls this device “Daily Adventure Incense.”

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_dai_part2_0_1
TEXT: Upon activation, it will attract Pokémon to your location for 15 minutes—so long as you are moving.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_dai_part2_0_2

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dailyincense_0_0

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dailyincense_0_1
TEXT: One Daily Adventure Incense lasts for 15 minutes and stays active only while you’re moving. Most importantly, though, this Incense can attract almost any Pokémon you’ve encountered before—even Legendary Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dailyincense_0_2
TEXT: I’ll give you one Daily Adventure Incense each day, so don’t be afraid to go out on some adventures! In fact, why not start one now? Try to catch as many Pokémon as you can!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_0_0
TEXT: It appears their aggression is primarily fueled by necessity...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_0_1
TEXT: Ah! Greetings again, Pokémon Trainer. You have found me mid-observation. An astounding amount of these Pokémon are present today—Deino, is it?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_0_2
TEXT: Bereft of sight, their first instinct is to bite. I have experienced this firsthand—but do not fret. The pain was minimal.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_0_3
TEXT: This world is replete with unique Pokémon. Though I wish to study them all, today’s focus will be on Deino alone.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_0_4
TEXT: May I borrow some moments from you, Pokémon Trainer? I would welcome your expertise in this endeavor.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_1_0
TEXT: Thank you for your assistance, Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_1_1
TEXT: Deino tackle and bite at their surroundings. Even in darkness, they find novel ways to navigate the world...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_1_2
TEXT: ......

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_1_3
TEXT: Ahem. Do you think the Deino seek anything in particular? Sustenance, perhaps?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_1_4
TEXT: I see. It is normal in your world to feed Berries to Pokémon when attempting to catch them. Hmm... Deino may not be able to see, but I wonder how well they can smell and taste.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_1_5
TEXT: I wish to investigate the acuity of these senses by seeing how Deino respond to Berries. Will you assist me, Pokémon Trainer?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_2_0
TEXT: How dee, Pokémon Trainer. I have observed you sending Gifts to your friends affixed with charming decorations. Stuckums, is it? No? Ah—stickers. What is the function of these adornments?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_2_1
TEXT: I see... So they are primarily decorative, but can also communicate certain sentiments. There seems to be much comradery among the Pokémon Trainers in this world.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_2_2
TEXT: Deino may bite and tackle each other, but perhaps what appears aggressive and unfriendly is simply an interaction we do not understand. Putting yourself in the mind of a Pokémon can illuminate new perspectives, do you not think?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_2_3
TEXT: Hm? Your Professor Willow would also share his observations of the Pokémon you encountered? I hope you find my musings equally helpful.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_2_4
TEXT: If I may muse further: I am eager to observe Deino’s Evolution. Its physical changes may inform its behavior.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_3_0
TEXT: Astounding. You have shown me yet another wonder of this world, Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_3_1
TEXT: I did not anticipate Deino would gain an additional head when it evolved to Zweilous—though I cannot discern if either head can see.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_3_2
TEXT: The two heads appear quite quarrelsome—particularly regarding food. Ah—be calm! There are Berries for all mouths!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_3_3
TEXT: Zweilous could learn much from the friendship you and I share. Perhaps it will do so as you travel together.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_3_4
TEXT: I have learned recently that Zweilous can evolve into a Pokémon called Hydreigon. Will it gain yet more heads? Will it trade quarrels for kindness?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_3_5
TEXT: Thank you for accompanying me in my investigation today, Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_3_6
TEXT: I presumed the mysteries of the Ultra Wormholes and Ultra Beasts would be my primary focus here—but the Pokémon of your world hold many mysteries of their own.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_0_0
TEXT: Greetings, Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_0_1
TEXT: There appears to be an increased number of Team GO Rocket members in the area.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_0_2
TEXT: I have yet to determine what they are doing here, but I suspect that a scheme of some sort is underway.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_0_3
TEXT: We should investigate before they decide to cause trouble.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_1_0
TEXT: Thank you, Pokémon Trainer. The atmosphere is improved with fewer Team GO Rocket members present.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_1_1
TEXT: One detail still mystifies me. Why do the Pokémon used by Team GO Rocket possess those peculiar auras?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_1_2
TEXT: I see. They become Shadow Pokémon through experimentation and mistreatment.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_1_3
TEXT: So they corrupt a blameless creature, and then they abandon it?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_1_4
TEXT: Their cruelty is unforgiveable.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_1_5
TEXT: I am coming to realize that this group will pursue their goals relentlessly and without conscience.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_1_6
TEXT: We must impede them however we can.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_1_7
TEXT: Come, Pokémon Trainer—let us begin by rescuing some Shadow Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_2_0
TEXT: Those poor Pokémon...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_2_1
TEXT: ... ... ...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_2_2
TEXT: Ah—Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_2_3
TEXT: Apologies for my dour demeanor. I cannot stop thinking about the Shadow Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_2_4
TEXT: Is there nothing we can do beyond rescuing them from Team GO Rocket? Will they remain in this state forever?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_2_5
TEXT: Hm? You are able to...purify them?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_2_6
TEXT: If doing so removes their ominous aura, I would like nothing more than to observe this phenomenon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_2_7
TEXT: Will you show me, Pokémon Trainer?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_3_0
TEXT: So this is a Purified Pokémon. Its shadowy aura is gone. In its place—radiance.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_3_1
TEXT: You are deserving of praise, Pokémon Trainer. But our efforts cannot end here. 

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_3_2
TEXT: Perhaps we should turn our attention to Team GO Rocket members of a higher standing.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_3_3
TEXT: If you can defeat their leaders in battle, we may hinder their plans.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_4_0
TEXT: Those battles were among the fiercest I have witnessed, Pokémon Trainer. I am fortunate to call you my ally.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_4_1
TEXT: Regrettably, it seems the Team GO Rocket leaders were not inspired to change their ways. They, too, have abandoned their Shadow Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_4_2
TEXT: But surely we have at least stalled their plans. Such an expansive organization cannot function without its leaders at full strength.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_4_3
TEXT: Hm? We must still deal with this...Giovanni, is it? I see.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_4_4
TEXT: Then our work is not yet finished, Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_5_0
TEXT: That was a fearsome battle, Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_5_1
TEXT: I am dazzled by your capacity to overcome any challenge set before you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_5_2
TEXT: Please, relish your well-earned victory—but we must remain vigilant. If Team GO Rocket were to manipulate the Ultra Beasts...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_5_3
TEXT: We do not want their villainy to interfere with our endeavors.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_5_4
TEXT: For now, however, I think we can turn our attention back to the Ultra Wormholes.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_5_5
TEXT: So long as they remain open in your world, more Ultra Beasts could appear.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_5_6
TEXT: Though considering the strength you displayed today, perhaps my fear is unnecessary.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_5_7
TEXT: In any case, thank you for allowing me to observe you today. I am pleased we were able to assist so many Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_5_8
TEXT: Until again, Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_starly_0_0
TEXT: Greetings, Pokémon Trainer. You have arrived at a convenient time. I would like you to assist me.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_starly_0_1
TEXT: I am only beginning to grow familiar with the sounds of this world. The rustling of leaves, the crashing of waves...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_starly_0_2
TEXT: But today I hear a new—there!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_starly_0_3
TEXT: That high-pitched chattering and stirring of air. Is it some sort of natural phenomenon?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_starly_0_4
TEXT: So you believe it to be caused by Pokémon. Intriguing.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_starly_0_5
TEXT: I am eager to locate the source. Let us proceed.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_starly_1_0
TEXT: So the multitude of Starly are the source of this cacophony.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_starly_1_1
TEXT: Though diminutive, they flap their wings with great power. And when they form a flock...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_starly_1_2
TEXT: I would not wish to be the target of their displeasure.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_starly_1_3
TEXT: The strength of such a small creature is a marvel.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_starly_1_4
TEXT: And if it were to evolve, I suspect that strength would only grow.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_starly_1_5
TEXT: Evolution affects Pokémon in such splendid ways. How will Starly change, do you think? Not another head, surely?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_starly_1_6
TEXT: After our experience with Deino, little would surprise me. Nevertheless, I would like to witness this transformation for myself.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_starly_2_0
TEXT: I am impressed yet again, Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_starly_2_1
TEXT: Staravia might not have grown an additional head, but it did increase in size.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_starly_2_2
TEXT: My early observations indicate that Staravia, too, prefer to travel in a flock.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_starly_2_3
TEXT: And when Staravia are not surrounded by their kind, they cry noisily. Perhaps they find comfort and security when together.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_starly_2_4
TEXT: I...can understand this.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_starly_2_5
TEXT: Ahem. Does it evolve further? What changes might that bring?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_starly_3_0
TEXT: Stunning. What a formidable physique.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_starly_3_1
TEXT: This musculature of this Pokémon—Staraptor, is it?—indicates great strength. It appears more than capable of carrying away its prey.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_starly_3_2
TEXT: And, unlike Starly and Staravia, it appears not to travel in flocks. Curious.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_starly_3_3
TEXT: The Pokémon of this world have such fascinating social structures. Some are more comfortable with others, and some find contentment alone.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_starly_3_4
TEXT: They are like humans in this way, do you not think?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_starly_3_5
TEXT: With each investigation we undertake, my understanding of your world is further illuminated.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_starly_3_6
TEXT: Thank you for your company, Pokémon Trainer. Until again.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_0_0
TEXT: What peculiar coloring. Is it an aberration, or—?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_0_1
TEXT: Ah. You have arrived at an opportune moment, Pokémon Trainer. Might I seek your insight?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_0_2
TEXT: Zigzagoon are present in vast numbers today, but they are notably different from those I have observed previously.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_0_3
TEXT: Zigzagoon’s fur is normally earthy in hue, but these Zigzagoon are black and white.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_0_4
TEXT: Can you explain this?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_0_5
TEXT: I see... These Zigzagoon were first discovered in the Galar region.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_0_6
TEXT: So a single Pokémon species can develop differently based on its habitat? Fascinating.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_0_7
TEXT: I will spend today observing these Galarian Zigzagoon. Will you assist me, Pokémon Trainer?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_1_0
TEXT: How energetic these Galarian Zigzagoon are. Have you also observed how they dash in a zigzag pattern?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_1_1
TEXT: I hypothesized that this may increase its evasiveness—but when I tested it myself, I grew quite dizzy.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_1_2
TEXT: Fret not, Pokémon Trainer—no people or Pokémon were harmed during my experiment.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_1_3
TEXT: I am left wondering whether evolution would ease or encourage Galarian Zigzagoon’s frenetic movements. Perhaps we can discover that answer together.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_2_0
TEXT: Thank you for your assistance, Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_2_1
TEXT: I have concluded that Galarian Linoone’s disposition is no calmer than Galarian Zigzagoon’s. Indeed, its aggression appears to have increased.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_2_2
TEXT: Not long before your arrival, I observed a group of Galarian Linoone using their long tongues to taunt other Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_2_3
TEXT: They then hurled themselves at their enraged foes.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_2_4
TEXT: I am continuously enthralled by the ways Pokémon interact with each other.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_2_5
TEXT: Might Galarian Linoone itself be capable of evolution? More research is required.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_3_0
TEXT: Greetings, Pokémon Trainer. You have brought me...Obstagoon, is it?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_3_1
TEXT: Unlike Galarian Linoone, Obstagoon stands on two legs. I surmise this is to establish a threatening posture.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_3_2
TEXT: What’s more, I witnessed firsthand its ability to make staggering vocal outbursts.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_3_3
TEXT: My heart has yet to return to its normal rhythm.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_3_4
TEXT: I find it remarkable that the assertive Obstagoon was once a diminutive Galarian Zigzagoon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_3_5
TEXT: How must it feel to experience such profound transformation? I assume your Professor Willow would have some insight.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_3_6
TEXT: This has been a valuable learning experience. Thank you for your assistance today, Pokémon Trainer.
