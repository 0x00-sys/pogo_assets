RESOURCE ID: aa_2022_okinawa_dialogue_0_1
TEXT: I can’t stop thinking about taking a vacation. I know we’re always outdoors researching, but taking a break and going somewhere new and just relaxing sounds so nice, doesn’t it?

RESOURCE ID: aa_2022_okinawa_dialogue_0_2
TEXT: Vacations are even better when you’ve got a Pokémon pal at your side!

RESOURCE ID: aa_2022_okinawa_dialogue_0_3
TEXT: In that spirit, why don’t you spend some time exploring the area with your Buddy Pokémon? Let’s see what there is to see!

RESOURCE ID: aa_2022_okinawa_dialogue_1_0
TEXT: You know, one of my favorite parts of traveling is trying out local foods. I think my Meltan would agree!

RESOURCE ID: aa_2022_okinawa_dialogue_1_1
TEXT: Once, it attempted to absorb a local camper’s mess kit—since, as you know, Meltan dissolves and eats metal. Luckily, I was able to avert that crisis before if got too, er...messy.

TEXT: Who needs a lid for their curry pot, anyway? Haha...

RESOURCE ID: aa_2022_okinawa_dialogue_1_3
TEXT: All this talk of food and the like has my stomach rumbling. I’m sure the local Pokémon would be thankful for some snacks, too. How about you share some Berries with them?

RESOURCE ID: aa_2022_okinawa_dialogue_2_0
TEXT: You know, I wonder if my mind’s been so fixated on flying somewhere far away because of all the Flying-type Pokémon in the area today. What do you think, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: aa_2022_okinawa_dialogue_2_1
TEXT: It sure would be nice to glide somewhere on a whim...

RESOURCE ID: aa_2022_okinawa_dialogue_2_2
TEXT: With such boundless freedom, why do you think all these Flying-type Pokémon chose to gather here? I know we’re supposed to be on vacation, but would you mind catching some Pokémon to help me understand this phenomenon, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: aa_2022_okinawa_dialogue_3_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! Thanks for catching those Pokémon for me. I really appreciate it!

RESOURCE ID: aa_2022_okinawa_dialogue_3_1

RESOURCE ID: aa_2022_okinawa_dialogue_3_2
TEXT: I’d go with you, but I think Meltan’s been nibbling on my research equipment again... We’ve talked about this, Meltan! Scrap metal only, please!

RESOURCE ID: aa_2022_okinawa_dialogue_4_0
TEXT: Good to see you! I hope you had a refreshing stroll.

RESOURCE ID: aa_2022_okinawa_dialogue_4_1
TEXT: In addition to all the Flying-type Pokémon, there seem to be a lot of unique Pikachu appearing in the area. I saw a few wearing rather stylish shirts and even some flying in the air with balloons!

RESOURCE ID: aa_2022_okinawa_dialogue_4_2

TEXT: Do you... Do you think there’s a chance that other Trainers you’ve passed on the street were actually Ditto? I suppose there’s no way to know for sure...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_af2022_2_11
TEXT: What a confusing but educational day this has been, %PLAYERNAME%. I hope you’ve enjoyed the Transform Pokémon’s shenanigans! Now, until next time, ... ... ...!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_af2022_2_2
TEXT: Er...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_af2022_2_3
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%? Is it really you?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_af2022_2_4
TEXT: Oh, thank goodness. I’ve had the most befuddling day.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_af2022_2_5
TEXT: The Pokémon in the area were behaving strangely, so, as always, I turned to you to help me find out why—but to my confusion, you just stared at me blankly and bit straight into a Nanab Berry!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_af2022_2_6
TEXT: The next thing I knew, “you” had transformed into a Ditto! Or perhaps I have that backwards? Whatever the case, it seems that all the oddly behaving Pokémon I’ve seen today were in fact Ditto in disguise.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_af2022_2_7
TEXT: Hm? You noticed it too, did you?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_af2022_2_8
TEXT: And you saw a Ditto that had transformed to look like me? Incredible!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_af2022_2_9
TEXT: As you’ve experienced, Ditto have the fascinating ability to reconstitute their entire cellular structure to transform into whatever they see.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_0_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! Isn’t it lovely out?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_0_1
TEXT: There are Litten lying in the sun, Rowlet relaxing in the trees, Popplio playing in the water—and these malasadas Spark dropped off sure are delicious!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_0_2
TEXT: It seems even the flowers smell sweeter today!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_0_3
TEXT: Why don’t you go out and see what Pokémon are around, %PLAYERNAME%? Maybe we’ll find something new to research!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_0_4
TEXT: I think I’ll sit this one out. Taking breaks is important!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_1_0
TEXT: Ah, you’re back already, %PLAYERNAME%—and with some new Pokémon in tow! Well done.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_1_1
TEXT: While you were gone, I noticed there’s something sparkling in the air today. Perhaps it’s a result of my radiant personality, eh, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_1_2
TEXT: Haha! Seriously though, it’s something I’m looking into.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_1_3
TEXT: For now, let’s have a look at the Pokémon you’ve caught.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_1_4
TEXT: Hmm, how curious. You appear to have caught several Pokémon that are often found on Alola’s Akala Island.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_1_5
TEXT: Akala Island has some amazing geographical features that make it a suitable habitat for a wide range of Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_1_6
TEXT: There’s Brooklet Hill, a fantastic fishing spot with a series of cascading waterfalls. And Lush Jungle, where trees grow densely together, as well as Wela Volcano Park—which, as you may have guessed, is a volcano!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_1_7
TEXT: How about keeping an eye out for Fire-, Water-, and Grass-type Pokémon while you’re out, %PLAYERNAME%? If my hunch is correct, you may run into more Pokémon often seen about Akala Island.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_2_0
TEXT: Well done, %PLAYERNAME%! That’s quite an assortment of Pokémon you’ve encountered.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_2_1
TEXT: I wish I’d been out there with you, but I wasn’t sitting idly by! I think I may have discovered why the air seems to be sparkling today.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_2_2
TEXT: You see, Blanche just reported witnessing a mysterious pink Pokémon behind a flower bush.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_2_3
TEXT: Based on its description, I believe Blanche may have seen Tapu Lele, the guardian deity of Akala Island.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_2_4
TEXT: The fragrant aroma of flowers is the source of Tapu Lele’s energy. Perhaps that has something to do with why the flowers smell so sweet today.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_2_5
TEXT: Spark and Blanche have both seen guardian deities now... Hmm. While I chew on that, let’s get out and look for Tapu Lele, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_3_0
TEXT: Whew! That was a good walk. I just got back myself, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_3_1
TEXT: I wasn’t able to find Tapu Lele, but I did manage to get a closer look at some of the sparkles I’ve been seeing in the air.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_3_2
TEXT: They appear to be the glowing scales Tapu Lele is known to scatter. Touching them is said to restore good health on the spot.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_3_3
TEXT: How did you fare during your investigation, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_3_4
TEXT: *gasp* You saw Tapu Lele?! That’s incredible!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_3_5
TEXT: So, we’ve been visited by two of Alola’s guardian deities now... What could they be here for, I wonder?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_3_6
TEXT: Tapu Lele is said to be guilelessly cruel, so I do hope we’re staying on its good side.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_3_7
TEXT: If I could just meet one of the guardian deities myself, it would help me form a solid hypothesis as to why they’re appearing...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_3_8
TEXT: But that’s for me to ponder. Don’t trouble yourself with it—go out and enjoy the day! I’ll be in touch soon. Let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_0_0
TEXT: Hello there, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_0_1
TEXT: I have something exciting planned for you today—you could even say it’s a mega surprise! Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_0_2
TEXT: I still have a few loose ends to wrap up, though.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_0_3
TEXT: While I finish my preparations, how about you take a quick survey of the area and see what Pokémon are out and about today?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_0_4
TEXT: I’ll be ready by the time you’re back.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1_0
TEXT: Ah, good—you’re back. I’ve just finished getting everything ready.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1_1
TEXT: Have you tried to Mega Evolve a Pokémon lately?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1_2
TEXT: Something about Mega Evolution caught my attention recently, so I was hoping you could help me investigate.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1_3
TEXT: Let’s take a closer look at Mega Evolution, from beginning to end.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1_4
TEXT: First, let’s choose which of these Pokémon you’d like to be the star of our research, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1_5
TEXT: Once we’re done, our understanding of Mega Evolution will be second to none.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1a_0
TEXT: So, you’ve chosen Venusaur, the Seed Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1a_1
TEXT: Venusaur absorbs solar energy as nutrition. By spreading the broad petals of its flower and catching the sun’s rays, it fills its body with power.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1a_2
TEXT: While I fetch Venusaur, how about you go out and catch a few Pokémon as a warm-up. Don’t forget to power them up, too.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1a_3
TEXT: You’ll have an even more formidable team by your side in no time!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1b_0
TEXT: So, you’ve chosen Charizard, the Flame Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1b_1
TEXT: Its bond with its Trainer is the source of its power. It boasts speed and maneuverability greater than that of a jet fighter.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1b_2
TEXT: While I fetch Charizard, how about you go out and catch a few Pokémon as a warm-up. Don’t forget to power them up, too.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1b_3
TEXT: You’ll have an even more formidable team by your side in no time!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1c_0
TEXT: So, you’ve chosen Blastoise, the Shellfish Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1c_1
TEXT: The jets of water it spouts from the rocket cannons on its shell can punch through thick steel.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1c_2
TEXT: While I fetch Blastoise, how about you go out and catch a few Pokémon as a warm-up. Don’t forget to power them up, too.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1c_3
TEXT: You’ll have an even more formidable team by your side in no time!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_2a_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! Now that we’re fully warmed up, let’s tuck into our research on Mega Evolution.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_2a_1
TEXT: Some theorize that a strong bond between a Trainer and a Pokémon is the key to Mega Evolution. We’ve also seen that Mega Energy can play a role.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_2a_2
TEXT: However, I noticed recently that if you Mega Evolve your Pokémon once using Mega Energy, you won’t need to use Mega Energy to Mega Evolve that Pokémon again.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_2a_3
TEXT: Let’s Mega Evolve Venusaur and see if that’s true for ourselves, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_2b_0

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_3a_0
TEXT: What a magnificent Mega Venusaur, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_3a_1
TEXT: Let’s keep growing: why don’t you take on a Raid Battle with your mighty Mega Venusaur? There may even be a Team GO Rocket Grunt lurking about, looking for a battle.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_3a_2
TEXT: Mega-Evolved Pokémon are powerful allies. Their strength in battle is unmatched!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_3a_3
TEXT: I’m sure there’s more to learn about Mega Evolution, so why stop now? Let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_3b_0

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_3b_1

TEXT: What a brilliant Mega Blastoise, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_3c_1
TEXT: Let’s keep our progress flowing: why don’t you take on a Raid Battle with your mighty Mega Blastoise? There may even be a Team GO Rocket Grunt lurking about, looking for a battle.

TEXT: I’m sure there’s more to learn about Mega Evolution, so why stop now? Let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! It’s great to see you, as always.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_0_1
TEXT: I’m feeling especially refreshed today, as if a pleasant island breeze were following me. Maybe it’s the freshly squeezed Pinap Juice I had for breakfast?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_0_2
TEXT: Or maybe it’s because more and more Pokémon first discovered in the Alola region have been coming to visit me lately!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_0_3
TEXT: Do you know about the Alola region, %PLAYERNAME%? It’s a cluster of tropical islands, each with unique scenery and Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_0_4
TEXT: Alola even has Pokémon whose appearances are different than their counterparts in other regions. You may have encountered some of them before!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_0_5
TEXT: Why don’t you try looking for some Pokémon that were first discovered in Alola while I rustle up another glass of juice? I’m sure we have a lot to learn about our visitors!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_1_0
TEXT: Good timing, %PLAYERNAME%! I just finished my juice.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_1_1
TEXT: Thanks for looking into the Alola region’s Pokémon! You’re as diligent as ever.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_1_2
TEXT: Let me take a look at what you’ve discovered. Hmm... It seems many of the Pokémon you just met can be found on Alola’s Melemele Island.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_1_3
TEXT: Melemele Island is where many of Alola’s Trainers begin their island challenge. It’s very fitting that the Pokémon you just met are also some of the first that young Trainers in Alola meet, too!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_1_4
TEXT: Now, let’s have a little more fun! Could you take a few snapshots of your new Pokémon friends or feed them some Berries, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_2_0
TEXT: Back already, %PLAYERNAME%? You and your Pokémon already seem to be closer. But who doesn’t love a good Pinap Berry? Speaking of, maybe it’s time for another glass of juice...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_2_1
TEXT: Delicious juice aside, did you know that each island in the Alola region has its own Island Guardian? Melemele Island’s guardian deity is Tapu Koko.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_2_2
TEXT: Why do I bring this up? Well, while you were away, I was looking for a clean glass and caught a startling yellow flash out of the corner of my eye!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_2_3
TEXT: The lightning-wielding Tapu Koko is known to fly faster than the eye can follow. With so many other Pokémon found on Melemele Island appearing, could it be that Tapu Koko is visiting as well?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_2_4
TEXT: Could you look around and see if you can spot Tapu Koko, %PLAYERNAME%? I’m eager to know if what I saw was truly the Land Spirit Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_3_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! What’s that? You were able to see Tapu Koko? That’s incredible!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_3_1
TEXT: And would you believe it: Spark was just here, raving that he’d seen Tapu Koko, too! So it is in the area after all. What an exceptional discovery, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_3_2
TEXT: I wonder why Tapu Koko is here. Tapu Koko is said to be a Pokémon brimming with curiosity—but, naturally, Island Guardians tend to stay on their respective islands. The fact that one of them is here may mean something is amiss...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_3_3
TEXT: Or did someone do something to anger it? I’ll have to do some more research before I can say anything for sure.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_3_4
TEXT: Do you think we’ll get a chance to meet the other Island Guardians, %PLAYERNAME%? Wouldn’t that be something.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_3_5
TEXT: I guess we’ll just have to wait and see. Until then, let’s kick back and enjoy a little R and R with our new friends!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_0_0
TEXT: Hello, %PLAYERNAME%! You’ve caught me at a curious time. You see, I was just out for a walk, thinking about how much I’d love to see a Mudkip, when—wouldn’t you know it—I came across a whole mess of them!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_0_1
TEXT: Did you know that Mudkip sleep by burying themselves in soil at the water’s edge? Sounds adorable, right?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_0_2
TEXT: One of the many things that’s always impressed me about Mudkip is how strong it is in spite of its size.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_0_3
TEXT: When faced with a tight situation in battle, Mudkip will unleash its amazing power. It can even crush rocks much bigger than itself!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_0_4
TEXT: It would be less than ideal if all these Mudkip were to do that right now... And yet, the researcher in me is curious to see it happen! Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_0_5
TEXT: Anyway, what do you say we do a bit of research on Mudkip, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%. I see you’ve brought a Mudkip with you—nice work!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_1_1
TEXT: Using the fin on its head, Mudkip senses the flow of water to keep track of what’s going on around it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_1_2
TEXT: I got a bit too close during my observations earlier, and those Mudkip splashed mud all over my coat! Which actually got me thinking about Mudkip’s Evolution, Marshtomp.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_1_3
TEXT: Living on muddy ground that provides poor footing has made Marshtomp’s legs sturdy.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_1_4
TEXT: And because it’s used to such slippery surfaces, Marshtomp can quickly overwhelm foes mired in mud.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_1_5
TEXT: While I clean my coat off, why don’t you try evolving your Mudkip so you can see Marshtomp firsthand, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_2_0
TEXT: I knew I should’ve brought an extra coat with me... Ah! Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%. That’s a very sturdy-looking Marshtomp you have with you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_2_1
TEXT: Don’t you think it’s inspiring how Pokémon thrive in all sorts of environments? Mudkip and Marshtomp seem like an especially versatile bunch.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_2_2
TEXT: Now, I have some exciting news. I caught a glimpse of some Swampert—Marshtomp’s Evolution—while you were away!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_2_3
TEXT: Swampert can not only break boulders into pieces with one swing of its arms, but it can also predict storms by sensing subtle differences in the sounds of waves and tidal winds with its fins!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_2_4
TEXT: I tend to get so engrossed in my research that I lose track of my surroundings, so having a Swampert around might be just what I need.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_2_5
TEXT: ...What’s that? I could just try to pay a bit more attention myself? Well, I suppose that’s an option... But not quite as fun, don’t you think? Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_2_6
TEXT: Why don’t you try evolving your Marshtomp, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_3_0
TEXT: Wow, %PLAYERNAME%! It’s hard to believe that Swampert of yours was once a tiny, adorable Mudkip. Pokémon really are incredible!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_3_1
TEXT: Swampert tend to make nests near beautiful beaches, and it’s strong enough to tow a large ship.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_3_2
TEXT: I guess you know which Pokémon to bring with you on your next beach vacation, eh?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_3_3
TEXT: You know, the last time I saw Mudkip appearing en masse like they are today, I also saw all manner of Trainers out exploring and researching, too.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_3_4
TEXT: It always fills me with joy to see everyone having fun with Pokémon. I hope you’ve enjoyed yourself today as well!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_3_5
TEXT: As for me, I think it’s time I stomp on home. I’ll be in touch!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_8_7
TEXT: You’ll never know what you’re capable of until you try, right?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_0_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%! How have you been? Finding time to relax, I hope? Perhaps with your Pokémon?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_0_1
TEXT: I’m enjoying a bit of a productivity boom, myself, but it’s made me realize that my research has gone uninterrupted for quite some time.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_0_2
TEXT: I fear there may be trouble brewing—specifically from Team GO Rocket. They’ve been too quiet for too long, don’t you think?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_0_3
TEXT: Would you mind patrolling the area to see if anything’s amiss?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_1_0
TEXT: Well done, %PLAYERNAME%. As much as I wish they’d give us a break, I know Team GO Rocket never rests—so neither can we!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_1_1
TEXT: I’m relieved to see you’ve rescued a couple of Shadow Pokémon from them already.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_1_2
TEXT: As both a professor and as someone who loves Pokémon, I can’t stand idly by as Team GO Rocket mistreats so many innocent Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_1_3
TEXT: Let’s get back out there and rescue some more Pokémon from them!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_2_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! Thanks for handling those Team GO Rocket Grunts. You and your Pokémon have done a great job of scaring them off, as usual!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_2_1
TEXT: They’ll think twice before showing up around here again, I suspect.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_2_2
TEXT: But those Shadow Pokémon they’ve left behind... Well, at least they’re safe with us now.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_2_3
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, let’s purify them so they can put their terrible time with Team GO Rocket in the past. I know they’ll be grateful for your help!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_3_0
TEXT: Those Pokémon are looking much better now, %PLAYERNAME%. I’m sure they’re relieved to be with a Trainer like you and away from Team GO Rocket.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_3_1
TEXT: Now that we’ve cleared out some of their underlings, I think we’d better track down the Team GO Rocket Leaders.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_3_2
TEXT: Based on how you handled those Grunts, I’m sure the Leaders won’t stand a chance!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_4_0
TEXT: You’ve done it, %PLAYERNAME%! Once again, you’ve been instrumental in stopping Team GO Rocket from getting their way.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_4_1
TEXT: It’s a privilege to watch you and your partners grow together and use your strength to help Pokémon everywhere.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_4_2
TEXT: Now. We’ve neutralized the Team GO Rocket Leaders, so it’s time to let Giovanni know that we’re not going to let him carry out his plan unchallenged.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_4_3
TEXT: I know he’s tough—but you’re tougher. I have the utmost confidence in you, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_5_0
TEXT: Incredible work, %PLAYERNAME%! You and your Pokémon have an impressive bond—one that Team GO Rocket will never be able match.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_5_1
TEXT: Pokémon everywhere are fortunate to have you on their side!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_5_2
TEXT: I know it won’t be long before Team GO Rocket appears with another scheme, but I can rest a bit easier knowing that you’re here to stop them right in their tracks.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_5_3
TEXT: For now, though, get some rest. You’ve more than earned it!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_0_0
TEXT: Good morning, %PLAYERNAME%! There sure seems to be a surplus of Sandshrew around today, don’t you think?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_0_1
TEXT: I’m especially surprised to see both Sandshrew and Alolan Sandshrew appearing at once!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_0_2
TEXT: These two forms of Sandshrew usually prefer vastly different climates. Sandshrew usually make their homes in deserts and arid zones, where rain doesn’t fall.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_0_3
TEXT: Alolan Sandshrew, on the other hand, are typically found in snowy mountains. What an uncommon sight for them to both be here together!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_0_4
TEXT: How about you spend some time with them and see what they’re up to, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! That’s an impressive number of Sandshrew you have in tow. I’d love to take a closer look at them—especially their shells.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_1_1
TEXT: Did you know that there’s a traditional competition in Alolan festivals where Trainers slide Alolan Sandshrew across ice as far as possible?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_1_2
TEXT: How must the Sandshrew feel about that, I wonder!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_1_3
TEXT: The Sandshrew first found in the Kanto region are quite fascinating in their own right.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_1_4
TEXT: When their shells are wrinkled from moisture, they head for volcanoes and lie flat on a spot with a lot of geothermal heat to dry themselves out.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_1_5
TEXT: It’s truly incredible how different geography and climates can influence Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_1_6
TEXT: I’d love to get an even closer look at both of these forms of Sandshrew. What do you say, %PLAYERNAME%? Let’s get back out there!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_2_0
TEXT: You never disappoint, %PLAYERNAME%! Seeing all the Sandshrew together, don’t they look like a tough bunch?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_2_1
TEXT: Sandshrew evolve into Sandslash, another hardy Pokémon. Alolan Sandslash use their large, hooked claws to cut paths through deep snow as they run.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_2_2
TEXT: On snowy mountains, these Sandslash are faster than any other Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_2_3
TEXT: But Sandslash first found in Kanto are tough, too! They climb trees by hooking on with their sharp claws.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_2_4
TEXT: They even share the Berries they gather by dropping them down to Sandshrew waiting on the ground. If only I could gather Berries so easily...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_2_5
TEXT: Try and evolve Sandshrew to Sandslash for yourself, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_3_0
TEXT: Great work, %PLAYERNAME%. Your new Sandslash are an impressive sight—befitting an impressive Trainer such as yourself!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_3_1
TEXT: Up close, you can really appreciate the differences in the spikes of these Sandslash.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_3_2
TEXT: The drier the area Sandslash lives in, the harder and smoother their spikes feel.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_3_3
TEXT: Meanwhile, Alolan Sandslash have beautiful icy spikes that glisten in the light of dawn.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_3_4
TEXT: Thanks for helping me look into these Sandshrew today, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_3_5
TEXT: I’ll keep studying Sandshrew and Sandslash in hopes of discovering more differences and similarities between them!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_3_6
TEXT: And I’ll be sure to get in touch the next time I need a helping hand. Something tells me it won’t be long!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_3_7
TEXT: Until next time, let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_10_5
TEXT: It didn’t take long for me to realize I was standing before a Trevenant, the Elder Tree Pokémon. Trevenant will trap people who harm their forest, never allowing them to leave.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_10_8
TEXT: Ghost-type Pokémon can seem frightening at first glance, but look a little closer and you’ll find they’re full of surprises. I’m sure the same goes for Hoopa!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_0_0
TEXT: *yawn* Hello, %PLAYERNAME%... You’ll have to forgive my appearance, I was up late last night studying some nearby Rowlet. For as sleepy as they can be during the day, they sure perk right up at night!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_0_1
TEXT: Maybe it’d help me relax if I had a soft, cute Pokémon to hug... Like Stufful!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_0_2
TEXT: Stufful has an adorable appearance, but it hates to be hugged or touched in any way. Which is a shame because I’ve heard its fur is a delight to pet!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_0_3
TEXT: I wonder if I’ll ever get the chance to snuggle one—for science, of course! Maybe you could bring me a Stufful, %PLAYERNAME%? Just to look at!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_1_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, you’re back! And you’ve brought a Stufful with you! It looks so soft and fluffy...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_1_1
TEXT: Er-hem! Despite their looks, Stufful are incredibly dangerous Pokémon. A touch from anyone except a known friend sends Stufful into a surging frenzy!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_1_2
TEXT: For both our sakes, maybe we’d better befriend it before we try to cuddle—I mean, continue our research, don’t you think? Why not try feeding Stufful a Berry or two, %PLAYERNAME%. Perhaps we can get closer to it that way.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_2_0
TEXT: Your Stufful seems friendlier already, %PLAYERNAME%! Speaking of friendly, have you heard that its Evolution—Bewear—has the habit of hugging its companions?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_2_1
TEXT: Once Bewear accepts you as a friend, it tries to show its affection with a hug. But letting it do that is dangerous—it could easily shatter your bones!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_2_2
TEXT: Many Trainers have left this world after their spines were squashed by its hug...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_2_3
TEXT: While I don’t recommend you go hugging a Bewear anytime soon, there isn’t any harm in trying to meet one! Why don’t you evolve Stufful, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_3_0
TEXT: What a strong-looking Bewear you’ve come back with, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_3_1
TEXT: What’s that? You say I look a bit more frazzled than usual? Well...I may have tried to pet Stufful while you were away, and its flailing sent me flying so far someone could’ve mistaken me for a bird Pokémon. Haha—ow...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_3_2
TEXT: On the bright side, I did get to both pet Stufful and experience its strength firsthand! Come to think of it, I have a colleague studying Pokémon moves who’d love to hear all about this...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_3_3
TEXT: I hope you’ve had more luck bonding with your new Stufful and Bewear companions, %PLAYERNAME%. I think I’m going to bow out and grab an ice pack...or six. Thanks for all your help today! Take care, I’ll be in touch!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_0_1
TEXT: Your timing is excellent. I’ve hit a bit of a roadblock in my research!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_0_2
TEXT: You see, I’m still puzzling over the guardian deities both Spark and Blanche have seen recently. I’ve yet to suss out why they’ve been appearing.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_0_3
TEXT: I can only hope they’re not angry with us—or worse!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_0_4
TEXT: I think I’ll take a break in the shade to clear my mind. It’s important to give your brain a breather now and then!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_0_5
TEXT: Why don’t you head out to find some shade for yourself, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! I see you’ve found some leafy Pokémon to rest under.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_1_1
TEXT: Are you feeling refreshed? I know I am!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_1_2
TEXT: While you were out, I thought of a new angle for our investigation.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_1_3
TEXT: As you may know, Alola is home to four guardian deities. We’ve seen two, so it stands to reason the other two may be buzzing about already.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_1_4
TEXT: Instead of waiting for them to come to us, I think we should get out and search for them ourselves.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_1_5
TEXT: Let’s start with Tapu Bulu, Guardian Deity of Ula’Ula Island.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_1_6
TEXT: Ula’Ula Island is a rugged locale, home to Mount Lanakila, the highest peak in Alola.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_1_7
TEXT: Tapu Bulu is said to make ringing sounds with its tail to let others know where it is and avoid unneeded conflicts. Knowing that, it shouldn’t be too hard to find!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_1_8
TEXT: In addition, I know Tapu Bulu can help plants grow, so perhaps we’ll have some luck if we begin by looking for Pokémon that are known to grow. Let’s get out there, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_2_0
TEXT: Ah, %PLAYERNAME%—you’re back. How did your search go?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_2_1
TEXT: I asked Candela to lend us a hand shortly after you left.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_2_2
TEXT: And just a few minutes later, before I’d even finished packing my gear, she came running back saying she’d heard a ringing in the air and looked up to see Tapu Bulu floating by!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_2_3
TEXT: Yet another guardian deity I’ve missed by a hair... Such is the fickle nature of Pokémon research, I suppose.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_2_4
TEXT: I’m glad you’ve at least been more successful, %PLAYERNAME%. Now that we know it’s out there, let’s double down on our search for Tapu Bulu!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_2_5
TEXT: I’ll speak with Candela to see if she might know any more details that could help us.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_3_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%—you saw Tapu Bulu, didn’t you!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_3_1
TEXT: What was it like? Tell me everything! Did you hear a ringing noise? Did you see it making vegetation grow, or maybe even swinging large trees around by their roots?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_3_2
TEXT: Those are all things Tapu Bulu is known for.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_3_3
TEXT: As you might’ve expected, I was—yet again—unable to witness Tapu Bulu myself. I did, however, think up a new theory.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_3_4
TEXT: The guardian deities seem to be keeping a relatively low profile. Perhaps they’re just here to investigate something, or even help us somehow.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_3_5
TEXT: Things may become clearer if we see Tapu Fini, the last of Alola’s guardian deities.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_3_6
TEXT: For now, though, I think we’ve earned some rest. See you next time, %PLAYERNAME%!
