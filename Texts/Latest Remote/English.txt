RESOURCE ID: quest_gofest2021_raid_dialogue_1_0
TEXT: Ah, %PLAYERNAME%! Just the Trainer I was hoping to see. Have you been enjoying the festival?

RESOURCE ID: quest_gofest2021_raid_dialogue_1_1
TEXT: I was just out on a stroll and witnessed the most incredible sight. Several rings had appeared in the sky, and as I stared up at them, something truly remarkable occurred.

RESOURCE ID: quest_gofest2021_raid_dialogue_1_2
TEXT: Legendary Pokémon began emerging from the rings as if by magic!

RESOURCE ID: quest_gofest2021_raid_dialogue_1_3
TEXT: Naturally, I rushed back to my laboratory and began frantically searching through every book I thought might shed some light on what had happened—but I’ve yet to find anything.

RESOURCE ID: quest_gofest2021_raid_dialogue_1_4
TEXT: I’m going to keep looking, but in the meantime, I could really use your help investigating in the field.

RESOURCE ID: quest_gofest2021_raid_dialogue_1_5
TEXT: We have to find out what’s going on here!

RESOURCE ID: quest_gofest2021_raid_dialogue_2_0
TEXT: Thanks for collecting that information, Trainer. I’m going to send it over to Blanche for analysis. Unfortunately, the rings in the sky have yet to disappear.

RESOURCE ID: quest_gofest2021_raid_dialogue_2_1
TEXT: I did have some luck in my search for an explanation, however. Look here—it’s the Mythical Pokémon Hoopa.

RESOURCE ID: quest_gofest2021_raid_dialogue_2_2
TEXT: Known as the Mischief Pokémon, Hoopa enjoys sending things to faraway places using its rings, which can warp space.

RESOURCE ID: quest_gofest2021_raid_dialogue_2_3
TEXT: That explains why those Legendary Pokémon appeared the way they did. Hoopa uses those rings to move things from place to place—including itself. It won’t be easy to catch.

RESOURCE ID: quest_gofest2021_raid_dialogue_2_4
TEXT: Based on reports from the team leaders, it doesn’t seem like Hoopa is in the area at the moment. Let’s use this time to prepare to catch it, hm?

RESOURCE ID: quest_gofest2021_raid_dialogue_2_5
TEXT: Mischievous though Hoopa may be, you have to admit that its rings are quite fascinating, eh, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_gofest2021_raid_dialogue_2_6
TEXT: Moments like this remind me of why I became a Pokémon Professor in the first place. The world of Pokémon is endlessly exciting!

RESOURCE ID: quest_gofest2021_raid_dialogue_2_7
TEXT: For now, why don’t you go challenge some raids with other Trainers and catch some Pokémon? You’ll need your skills at their sharpest to catch Hoopa. Now, let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_gofest_2021_dialogue_energetic_9_2

RESOURCE ID: quest_gofest_2021_dialogue_energetic_9_3

RESOURCE ID: quest_gofest_2021_dialogue_intro_1_0
TEXT: The theme of this year’s Pokémon GO Fest is music, so let’s try our best to put on a good show! The team leaders are hard at work setting up a top-class stage.

RESOURCE ID: quest_gofest_2021_dialogue_intro_1_1
TEXT: With a director like you, I know we’re in for a performance we won’t soon forget.

RESOURCE ID: quest_gofest_2021_dialogue_intro_1_2
TEXT: But for that, you’ll need a talented act! And with that in mind, there’s a certain Pikachu backstage that’s buzzing to meet you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_gofest_2021_dialogue_intro_1_3
TEXT: It’s got makeup and wardrobe standing by to help tailor its look to match your vision for the festival. Do you think you’d rather put on a rock show or a pop show?

RESOURCE ID: quest_gofest_2021_dialogue_intro_1_4
TEXT: Pikachu’s ready to dazzle either way, so it’s really up to you! For now, I’d suggest you go for a stroll and give your decision some thought. Maybe you could pick a genre that matches one of your favorite songs?

RESOURCE ID: quest_gofest_2021_dialogue_popstar_2_0

RESOURCE ID: quest_gofest_2021_dialogue_popstar_3_0

RESOURCE ID: quest_gofest_2021_dialogue_popstar_3_4

RESOURCE ID: quest_gofest_2021_dialogue_popstarponyta_5_2

RESOURCE ID: quest_gofest_2021_dialogue_popstarzigzagoon_4_0

RESOURCE ID: quest_gofest_2021_dialogue_popstarzigzagoon_4_1

RESOURCE ID: quest_gofest_2021_dialogue_rockstarponyta_4_2

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_0_1
TEXT: Not sure if you’ve noticed, but there seems to be a huge influx of Eevee, the Evolution Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_0_2
TEXT: Some theorize that the key to the mysteries of Pokémon Evolution lies within Eevee’s genetics.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_0_3
TEXT: I can understand that hypothesis—after all, Eevee can evolve into EIGHT Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_0_4
TEXT: I sure wish I were as adaptable as Eevee!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_0_5
TEXT: I don’t even have eight different outfits. I basically wear this lab coat all the time—even to formal events!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_0_6
TEXT: Anyway, perhaps by researching Eevee, we’ll unravel even more mysteries of Pokémon Evolution!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_0_7
TEXT: I can’t wait to get started! Let’s GO learn about Eevee!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_1_0
TEXT: Great work with your research on Eevee, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_1_1
TEXT: According to my findings, Eevee’s irregular DNA gives it the ability to evolve into many different Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_1_2
TEXT: For example, it has three Evolutions originally discovered in the Kanto region: the Water-type Vaporeon, the Electric-type Jolteon, and the Fire-type Flareon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_1_3
TEXT: Isn’t it fascinating that Eevee can evolve into Pokémon of such different types?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_1_4
TEXT: As you work on your Eevee research, perhaps you might learn more about these Pokémon. Good luck!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_2_0
TEXT: Great work, %PLAYERNAME%! I see you’ve gotten a Vaporeon, a Jolteon, and a Flareon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_2_1
TEXT: These incredible creatures are capable of some impressive feats.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_2_2
TEXT: Did you know that Vaporeon can melt away into water?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_2_3
TEXT: Or that Jolteon can blast out 10,000-volt lightning bolts?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_2_4
TEXT: And that Flareon breathes fire that is over 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_2_5
TEXT: Isn’t it amazing that all three of these Pokémon evolve from Eevee?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_2_6
TEXT: Perhaps there’s something besides genetics that gives Eevee so much potential.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_2_7
TEXT: Let’s do some more research to learn more about Eevee. At certain times of the day, this Pokémon can evolve into Pokémon originally discovered in the Johto region: the Psychic-type Espeon and the Dark-type Umbreon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_2_8
TEXT: If you keep up your research, you might find them as well!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_3_0
TEXT: Great work, %PLAYERNAME%! Looks like you’ve gotten yourself an Espeon and an Umbreon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_3_1
TEXT: The Psychic-type Espeon can use the fine hair on its body to sense air currents and predict its enemies’ next move. It usually evolves from Eevee during the daytime.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_3_2
TEXT: As for the Dark-type Umbreon, it evolves from Eevee during the nighttime. It’s said that Umbreon’s rings glow yellow under the full moon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_3_3
TEXT: Who would’ve thought that something like the time of day could affect Pokémon Evolution!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_3_4
TEXT: It’s wonderful to delve even deeper into the mysteries of Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_3_5
TEXT: Let’s keep it up by researching Eevee’s Evolutions that were originally discovered in the Sinnoh region.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_3_6
TEXT: The Grass-type Leafeon and Ice-type Glaceon seem to have evolved in order to adapt to their environment.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_3_7
TEXT: Why don’t you research these Pokémon next?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_4_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, welcome back!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_4_1
TEXT: I see you’ve managed to get a Leafeon and a Glaceon! Congratulations!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_4_2
TEXT: The vastly different environments in the Sinnoh region appear to have caused the adaptable Eevee to evolve into a Grass-type Pokémon and an Ice-type Pokémon. It’s inspiring to see how resilient this little Pokémon can be!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_4_3
TEXT: We might not uncover all the secrets of Pokémon Evolution today, but I think we can learn a lot about ourselves through Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_4_4
TEXT: Researching Eevee today has taught me there are so many paths in life to choose from.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_4_5
TEXT: I hope that Eevee can inspire you to find the one that suits you best.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_4_6
TEXT: But enough of this professor’s ramblings. Eevee is known to have just one more Evolution—the Fairy-type Sylveon, which was originally discovered in the Kalos region.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_4_7
TEXT: This Pokémon has ribbonlike feelers that it uses to calm others. Sylveon evolves from Eevee when it reaches a certain level of friendship and trust with its beloved Trainer. Knowing that almost brings a tear to my eye!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_4_8
TEXT: I hope you have the good fortune of crossing paths with a wonderful Pokémon like Sylveon sometime soon.
