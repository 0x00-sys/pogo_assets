RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_0_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%! It’s so great to see you! The strangest things have been happening lately.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_0_1
TEXT: You see, I begin each day with a Pinap Berry and coffee for breakfast, then head outside my lab to take in the crisp morning air before starting my research.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_0_2
TEXT: A couple days ago, however, I stepped outside and slipped on a sheet of ice right outside the entrance of my lab! Coffee—spilled. Pinap Berry—squished. Day—ruined.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_0_3
TEXT: At first, I thought the ice formed because it was an especially chilly day, but it was in fact nowhere near cold enough to create a sheet of ice that thick!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_0_4
TEXT: For my sake—and my breakfast’s—can you help me research Ice-type Pokémon to see whether we can discover anything? *sniffle* My poor breakfast...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_1_0
TEXT: Great work, %PLAYERNAME%! We’ve learned quite a bit about Ice-type Pokémon, and it looks as if you’ve caught a few interesting ones!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_1_1
TEXT: I feel like we’re getting closer to finding out the cause of my breakfast’s untimely demise. Oh! There’s something I forgot to mention.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_1_2
TEXT: That very evening—after an incredibly sad, breakfast-less day—I was trying to cheer myself up by dressing in my comfiest pajamas and drinking a cup of herbal tea before tucking into bed.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_1_3
TEXT: As I lay there, ready to count Mareep and fall asleep, I was suddenly awoken by some unnerving tapping outside my lab! It sounded like...tap-dancing?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_1_4
TEXT: I was simply too comfortable in bed—and too frightened—to get up and check. All I could do was lie there and hope the tapping would end soon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_1_5
TEXT: I now believe source of that tapping was the same Pokémon that created the sheet of ice in front of my mobile lab.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_1_6
TEXT: Can you investigate some Pokémon related to making peculiar sounds? Let’s see whether we can get closer to solving this case before it goes cold.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_2_0
TEXT: ... ... ... OH! %PLAYERNAME%, you scared me. I was a bit distracted thinking about the tap-dancing I heard last night, as well as the shadow I saw pass by my window.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_2_1
TEXT: Oh, I didn’t mention that last part? Yes, it was quite an unnerving experience! Anyway, let me take a look at all the research you’ve done.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_2_2
TEXT: Oh! OH! Oh my goodness! All right, I think I know the source of these strange occurrences now.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_2_3
TEXT: I believe the culprit is the Galarian form of the Barrier Pokémon—Mr. Mime!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_2_4
TEXT: Galarian Mr. Mime is known as the Dancing Pokémon. It likes to create a sheet of ice and tap-dance on it. What a strange Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_2_5
TEXT: While Galarian Mr. Mime is the prime suspect, it’s still just a hunch. Can you go out and do a bit more research to confirm? Maybe you might even come across a Galarian Mr. Mime!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_3_0
TEXT: Phew! Great job catching that Galarian Mr. Mime, %PLAYERNAME%! I guess it’s not as frightening as I first thought.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_3_1
TEXT: Perhaps it’ll become even more approachable when it evolves?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_3_2
TEXT: I’ve read that Galarian Mr. Mime evolves into Mr. Rime, the Comedian Pokémon. Mr. Rime is apparently highly skilled at tap-dancing and waves its cane of ice in time with its graceful movements.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_3_3
TEXT: I wonder whether it could teach me some new moves. Haha! Anyway, how about you try evolving your Galarian Mr. Mime?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_4_0
TEXT: What a fascinating Pokémon Mr. Rime is! Thank you for evolving your Galarian Mr. Mime, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_4_1
TEXT: I've heard stories of Mr. Rime’s amusing movements, and you know what? Color me amused. What a COOL discovery this was!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_4_2
TEXT: This has definitely been an unforgettable adventure, but I’m not sure I can say I’d do it again, given the chilling way it started. My poor breakfast...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_4_3
TEXT: Until next time, %PLAYERNAME%. Let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_1_6
TEXT: With that in mind, I think it’s time for you to head out and put your skills to the test!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_0_0
TEXT: ...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_0_1
TEXT: Oh! %PLAYERNAME%, you caught me by surprise. I was just thinking about some movies I’ve seen recently.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_0_2
TEXT: What, you didn’t take me for a movie guy? Haha! Well, while the world of Pokémon is my greatest passion, I’ve been trying to explore my interests outside of research and Pokémon as well.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_0_3
TEXT: Self-discovery is important for personal growth in all walks of life. It can also be quite fun! I’ve learned that I really enjoy watching a film to pass the time now and again.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_0_4
TEXT: Also, a lot of movies feature Pokémon! Don’t you love it when your interests overlap?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_0_5
TEXT: I saw an incredibly thrilling action movie the other day. It was about a fighter who, against all odds, becomes a professional boxer alongside his trusty Machop.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_0_6
TEXT: Life had him on the ropes, but he just kept punching back! Talk about inspiring.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_0_7
TEXT: Did you know that Machop love to work out and build their muscles? They’re never satisfied, even when they train hard all day long! I wish I had that energy when I do fieldwork!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_0_8
TEXT: Speaking of Machop: Did you notice that more of them are appearing in the wild? That’s what reminded me of that movie in the first place!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_0_9
TEXT: Could you head out and learn more about Machop?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_1_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! Great job catching all those Machop. I wonder if you’ll grow as close as the two characters in that movie.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_1_1
TEXT: The main character started in a pretty tough place, but his Machop kept him motivated and inspired.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_1_2
TEXT: Then, he was given an incredible opportunity to compete against other fighters. My favorite part was when his Machop evolved into Machoke!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_1_3
TEXT: Isn’t the relationship between a Trainer and their Pokémon wonderful? Machoke are truly remarkable Pokémon, too.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_1_4
TEXT: A Machoke’s muscular body is so powerful, the Pokémon must wear a power-save belt to regulate its motions.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_1_5
TEXT: As it happens, you should have enough Machop Candies now to evolve Machop into a Machoke of your own. It’s almost like you’re living out that movie yourself!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_2_0
TEXT: Wow—that’s one muscular Machoke! Great work evolving it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_2_1
TEXT: Sometimes, Machoke will head to fields and mountains to exercise and train. Isn’t that dedication amazing?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_2_2
TEXT: It reminds me of a training montage in that film. The Trainer and his Machoke traveled to the mountains to train together.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_2_3
TEXT: Watching their friendship blossom almost moved me to tears! The way they encouraged each other reminded me why I love Pokémon, especially when the Machoke evolved into Machamp!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_2_4
TEXT: Oops, there I go again… Anyway, Machop and Machoke are very impressive Pokémon, but Machamp is on an entirely different level.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_2_5
TEXT: Its four arms react more quickly than it can think, so Machamp can execute several punches at once!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_2_6
TEXT: Hoo-hah! That was the movie Machamp’s signature move. Haha, who knew I’d become such a film buff? Get it? Buff?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_2_7
TEXT: Moving right along…

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_2_8
TEXT: How about you do a bit of research on Machamp? Your Machoke seems pumped to get stronger. Let’s try evolving it into Machamp and see what happens!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_3_0
TEXT: Wow, %PLAYERNAME%! I saw you approaching with your newly evolved Machamp, and I almost couldn’t believe my eyes. It was just like the end of that movie!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_3_1
TEXT: The Trainer ended up winning the tournament, and he couldn’t have done it without his Machamp by his side.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_3_2
TEXT: Movies are so powerful! Especially ones about Pokémon and their Trainers.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_3_3
TEXT: I suppose you and Machamp don’t need to watch that particular film, though—you practically lived it today! It’s been inspiring to witness, and I hope to carry that inspiration with me as I grow closer to my own Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_3_4
TEXT: You never know what you’ll discover about yourself when you try new things—just like how you never know which Pokémon you’ll end up forming a lifelong friendship with until you catch them!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_3_5
TEXT: Thanks for coming along with me on this journey, Trainer. I wish you and your Machamp well, and I’ll see you next time. Let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_0_0
TEXT: Ahhh... Do you smell that, Trainer?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_0_1
TEXT: I first caught a whiff of that curious aroma as I was out on my daily morning walk.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_0_2
TEXT: Upon investigation, I discovered that the scent was being produced by an uncommonly large group of Roselia that had assembled nearby.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_0_3
TEXT: Did you know you can judge a Roselia’s health by the strength of its aroma? Well, let me tell you—those were VERY healthy Roselia!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_0_4
TEXT: But while they certainly smell nice and look pretty, I advise you to take care when encountering them.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_0_5
TEXT: The thorns on Roselia’s head contain a vicious poison, and it can launch them at any opponent bold enough to try to steal the flowers on its arms. Every rose, as they say!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_0_6
TEXT: It’s unusual to see so many Roselia in one place. Would you mind assisting me in researching this phenomenon?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_1_1
TEXT: While you were out in the field, I did some reading on Roselia.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_1_2
TEXT: When it comes to Pokémon, new discoveries are being made all the time—so it’s important to make sure your information is up to date.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_1_3
TEXT: Roselia, the Thorn Pokémon, evolves from Budew, the Bud Pokémon. Budew is sensitive to changes in temperature, and its bud is said to bloom when warmed by the sun.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_1_4
TEXT: It’s also both Grass and Poison type, much like Roselia.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_1_5
TEXT: In reviewing these two Pokémon, I remembered something tremendously exciting! I still need to conduct a bit more research before sharing my findings, however. Would you mind assisting me?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_2_0
TEXT: As aromatic Pokémon go, we’re pretty fortunate it’s Roselia appearing en masse and not, say, Muk.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_2_1
TEXT: A big group of Muk gathered under the sun... The whole place would smell like baked garbage!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_2_2
TEXT: Oh! Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%. Didn’t realize you were back.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_2_3
TEXT: I found that interesting bit of information I wanted to share with you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_2_4
TEXT: According to my research, Roselia that drink nutritionally rich springwater are said to reveal rare coloration when they bloom.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_2_5
TEXT: Isn’t that fascinating? Have you seen anything like that while you’ve been out doing research?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_2_6

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_2_7
TEXT: Now that you’re back, I’d like you to evolve a Roselia with the Sinnoh Stone I gave you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_2_8
TEXT: I’m excited to see the final Evolution in this line of Grass- and Poison-type Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_3_0
TEXT: Great work, Trainer! Your Roselia has evolved into the Bouquet Pokémon, Roserade!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_3_1
TEXT: It moves like a dancer and strikes with whips that are densely lined with poison thorns.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_3_2
TEXT: Oh, and have you noticed that each of Roserade’s hands is a different color?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_3_3
TEXT: Each contains a different toxin. The poison in its right hand is quick acting, while the poison in its left hand is slow acting.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_3_4
TEXT: What an amazing Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_3_5
TEXT: Thanks for all your assistance today, Trainer. Documenting situations like this is essential to learning more about the Pokémon in the world around us.
