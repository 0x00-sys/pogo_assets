RESOURCE ID: quest_evolve_special_galarian_mrmime
TEXT: Evolve a Galarian Mr. Mime

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_0_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%! It’s so great to see you! The strangest things have been happening lately.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_0_1
TEXT: You see, I begin each day with a Pinap Berry and coffee for breakfast, then head outside my lab to take in the crisp morning air before starting my research.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_0_2
TEXT: A couple days ago, however, I stepped outside and slipped on a sheet of ice right outside the entrance of my lab! Coffee—spilled. Pinap Berry—squished. Day—ruined.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_0_3
TEXT: At first, I thought the ice formed because it was an especially chilly day, but it was in fact nowhere near cold enough to create a sheet of ice that thick!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_0_4
TEXT: For my sake—and my breakfast’s—can you help me research Ice-type Pokémon to see whether we can discover anything? *sniffle* My poor breakfast...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_1_0
TEXT: Great work, %PLAYERNAME%! We’ve learned quite a bit about Ice-type Pokémon, and it looks as if you’ve caught a few interesting ones!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_1_1
TEXT: I feel like we’re getting closer to finding out the cause of my breakfast’s untimely demise. Oh! There’s something I forgot to mention.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_1_2
TEXT: That very evening—after an incredibly sad, breakfast-less day—I was trying to cheer myself up by dressing in my comfiest pajamas and drinking a cup of herbal tea before tucking into bed.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_1_3
TEXT: As I lay there, ready to count Mareep and fall asleep, I was suddenly awoken by some unnerving tapping outside my lab! It sounded like...tap-dancing?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_1_4
TEXT: I was simply too comfortable in bed—and too frightened—to get up and check. All I could do was lie there and hope the tapping would end soon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_1_5
TEXT: I now believe source of that tapping was the same Pokémon that created the sheet of ice in front of my mobile lab.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_1_6
TEXT: Can you investigate some Pokémon related to making peculiar sounds? Let’s see whether we can get closer to solving this case before it goes cold.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_2_0
TEXT: ... ... ... OH! %PLAYERNAME%, you scared me. I was a bit distracted thinking about the tap-dancing I heard last night, as well as the shadow I saw pass by my window.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_2_1
TEXT: Oh, I didn’t mention that last part? Yes, it was quite an unnerving experience! Anyway, let me take a look at all the research you’ve done.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_2_2
TEXT: Oh! OH! Oh my goodness! All right, I think I know the source of these strange occurrences now.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_2_3
TEXT: I believe the culprit is the Galarian form of the Barrier Pokémon—Mr. Mime!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_2_4
TEXT: Galarian Mr. Mime is known as the Dancing Pokémon. It likes to create a sheet of ice and tap-dance on it. What a strange Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_2_5
TEXT: While Galarian Mr. Mime is the prime suspect, it’s still just a hunch. Can you go out and do a bit more research to confirm? Maybe you might even come across a Galarian Mr. Mime!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_3_0
TEXT: Phew! Great job catching that Galarian Mr. Mime, %PLAYERNAME%! I guess it’s not as frightening as I first thought.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_3_1
TEXT: Perhaps it’ll become even more approachable when it evolves?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_3_2
TEXT: I’ve read that Galarian Mr. Mime evolves into Mr. Rime, the Comedian Pokémon. Mr. Rime is apparently highly skilled at tap-dancing and waves its cane of ice in time with its graceful movements.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_3_3
TEXT: I wonder whether it could teach me some new moves. Haha! Anyway, how about you try evolving your Galarian Mr. Mime?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_4_0
TEXT: What a fascinating Pokémon Mr. Rime is! Thank you for evolving your Galarian Mr. Mime, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_4_1
TEXT: I've heard stories of Mr. Rime’s amusing movements, and you know what? Color me amused. What a COOL discovery this was!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_4_2
TEXT: This has definitely been an unforgettable adventure, but I’m not sure I can say I’d do it again, given the chilling way it started. My poor breakfast...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_4_3
TEXT: Until next time, %PLAYERNAME%. Let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_0_0
TEXT: Jessie: Hey, James, did you hear?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_0_1
TEXT: James: What is it, Jessie?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_0_2
TEXT: Jessie: Apparently, there’s a mysterious Pokémon in a jungle nearby!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_0_3
TEXT: James: Go on!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_0_4
TEXT: Jessie: They say it’s called the Protector of the Jungle or something like that.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_0_5
TEXT: James: Oh? That sounds like the kind of Pokémon the Boss would be happy to see!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_0_6
TEXT: Jessie: It’s going to be a pain, though, since we don’t really know the area.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_0_7
TEXT: James: Hmmm, maybe we can con someone into helping us!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_0_8
TEXT: Jessie: Yeah... Huh? Hey, you! You must be an assistant the Boss sent! Yeah, why else would someone be out here in the middle of nowhere?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_0_9
TEXT: James: Assistant? Oh! Of course! An assistant! The Boss has high expectations for us, after all. Now that you’re here, let’s get to work.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_1_0
TEXT: Jessie: Nice work, kid! I can’t believe you actually did it!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_1_1
TEXT: James: Yeah! It feels nice to have somebody to boss around— I mean, uh, somebody to help us out! Jessie and I are constantly on our feet, you know.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_1_2
TEXT: Jessie: As you can imagine, it’s hard for us to maintain our good looks when we’re always running around like this. Anyway, you did your bit, so I guess we can let you take a little break.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_1_3
TEXT: James: Superb idea, Jessie! It’s important to change up the pace every once in a while!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_1_4
TEXT: James: Go on and spend some time with your buddy.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_0
TEXT: Jessie: I’m so glad the Boss sent along someone so useful to help us!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_1
TEXT: James: Now that you mention it, you haven’t told us anything about yourself. Where are you normally stationed? How long have you been with Team Rocket? Oh, what’s your favorite thing about the Boss? Do tell!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_10
TEXT: James: Hey, who exactly are you?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_11
TEXT: James: ... ... ...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_12
TEXT: Jessie: You’d better start talking.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_13
TEXT: Jessie: Aha! I knew you were just a no-good Twerp! This whole thing was suspicious from the start! Did someone send you to get in our way?! Yeah, that must be it!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_14
TEXT: James: I trusted you! I thought you were one of us!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_15
TEXT: Jessie: You know too much! We can’t let you go! Let’s get ’em, James!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_16
TEXT: James: Don’t you dare get in our way! You’ll regret it if you do!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_17
TEXT: Jessie: Don’t you know who we are?! Well, let us formally introduce ourselves!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_18
TEXT: Jessie: Prepare for trouble...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_19
TEXT: James: And make it double!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_2

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_20
TEXT: Jessie: To protect the world from devastation!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_21

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_3
TEXT: James: Hey, why so quiet all of a sudden?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_4
TEXT: James: Jessie, who actually told you that we’d be getting an assistant?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_5
TEXT: Jessie: Nobody told ME anything!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_6
TEXT: James: Well, no one told me, either!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_7
TEXT: Jessie: But you’re the one who said they were sent by the Boss!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_8
TEXT: James: I said no such thing!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_9
TEXT: James: ... ... ...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_3_0
TEXT: Jessie: I can’t believe we were defeated by a Twerp like you!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_3_1

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_3_2
TEXT: James: Huh?!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_3_3
TEXT: Jessie: Hey, behind you! Isn’t that Celebi? Could it be the so-called Protector of the Jungle?!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_3_5
