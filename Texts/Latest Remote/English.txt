After a Pokémon Mega Evolves, you’ll need to wait a while before it can Mega Evolve again without using Mega Energy. You can also use Mega Energy to Mega Evolve your Pokémon before then.

RESOURCE ID: mega_level_tutorial_page5_body
TEXT: Each Mega-Evolved Pokémon has a Mega Level. When a Pokémon’s Mega Level increases, you’ll get more bonuses, and the period you’ll have to wait before you can Mega Evolve the Pokémon again will be shorter. Each time you Mega Evolve a Pokémon, you work toward increasing its Mega Level.

TEXT: Er...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_0_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%! Wonderful to see you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_0_1
TEXT: You may know this already, but some Pokémon have different forms depending on the region they appear in, like Geodude. In most places, Geodude are described as being very similar to rocks—so much so that many Trainers mistake them for boulders.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_0_2
TEXT: Uniquely, the Geodude found in Alola are Rock- and Electric-type, while the Geodude found in Kanto are Rock- and Ground-type. Fascinating, don't you think?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_0_3
TEXT: You know, if you accidentally step on an Alolan Geodude, you'll hear a crunching sound and feel a shock ripple through your entire body.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_0_4
TEXT: I’d read about this phenomenon some time ago, but I was, er, “lucky” enough to experience it myself earlier today. Suffice it to say it left me feeling electrified!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_0_5
TEXT: Why don’t you head out to find some Alolan Geodude for yourself? Just make sure to watch your step!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! I see you had no trouble finding Alolan Geodude.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_1_1
TEXT: When Alolan Geodude evolves into Alolan Graveler, it becomes even more impressive. Alolan Graveler’s food of choice is a mineral called dravite. After eating it, crystals form inside the Pokémon, rising to the surface in some parts of its body.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_1_2
TEXT: Oh! And this fact’s my favorite: When two Alolan Graveler clash, it fills the surrounding area with flashes of light and sound. People call it the “fireworks of the earth”!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_1_3
TEXT: You know, I’d really like to see Alolan Graveler for myself. Think you can help me out, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_2_0
TEXT: Well done! That’s a mighty Alolan Graveler you’ve got there.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_2_1
TEXT: I’d love to see those “fireworks of the earth” for myself, but...maybe later. And much farther from my lab.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_2_2
TEXT: In any case! While you were away, I continued with some field research of my own. I saw the most curious thing—an Alolan Geodude flying through the air!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_2_3
TEXT: I suspect it was the work of Alolan Golem, the Evolution of Alolan Graveler. Alolan Golem can shoot large rocks that are charged with electricity. However, because it can’t fire boulders at a rapid pace, it’s been known to grab nearby Geodude and fire them instead.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_2_4
TEXT: Can you do some research to help me understand what I saw?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_3_0
TEXT: Ah, you’re back—and with an Alolan Golem!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_3_1
TEXT: Alolan Golem are known to be grumpy and stubborn. If you upset them, they discharge electricity from the surface of their bodies and let out a growl that sounds like thunder.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_3_2
TEXT: Between that and their penchant for launching Geodude in lieu of boulders, we’d best be careful around Alolan Golem.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_3_3
TEXT: You have an incredible knack for befriending Pokémon, though, so I’m sure you’ll be the best of pals in no time!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_3_4
TEXT: Thanks for assisting me with my research today, %PLAYERNAME%. It always “rocks” to have your help! Heh heh... See you next time!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_0_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%! Good to see you. How’ve you been? Rested and relaxed, I hope?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_0_1
TEXT: I’ve been full of energy since I saw Tapu Fini. And as I thought more about that encounter, I realized that over these past few months, we’ve been seeing quite a few Pokémon that were first found in Alola.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_0_2
TEXT: And you—you’ve even been lucky enough to see all four of Alola’s island guardians!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_0_3
TEXT: I can’t say I’m completely free of envy, but I’m glad you were able to have those experiences.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_0_4
TEXT: After all, we professors owe much of our learning to adventurous Trainers like yourself!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_0_5
TEXT: I wonder if our friendship would be as fruitful if our roles were reversed... I’d sure like to hope so! Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_0_6
TEXT: Keep exploring, %PLAYERNAME%. You never know what you might find!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! Look at that—you’ve caught all of Alola’s first partner Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_1_1
TEXT: They make for quite the iconic trio.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_1_2
TEXT: Let’s continue our Alola-inspired research today!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_1_3
TEXT: Which of Alola’s islands piques your interest the most, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2a_0
TEXT: So you’re interested in Melemele Island, eh? No surprise there—it’s one of my favorites as well.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2a_1
TEXT: Though perhaps that isn’t saying much... They’re all my favorites, really! Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2a_2
TEXT: As we’ve discussed, Melemele Island is where many Trainers in Alola begin the region’s island challenge.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2a_3
TEXT: There’s even a Trainers’ School there, where aspiring young Trainers can make friends and study up on all things Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2a_4
TEXT: In the spirit of Melemele Island, why don’t you go meet some new Pokémon and send some Gifts to your friends?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2b_0
TEXT: So you’re interested in Akala Island, eh? No surprise there—it’s one of my favorites as well.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2b_1
TEXT: Though perhaps that isn’t saying much... They’re all my favorites, really! Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2b_2
TEXT: As I mentioned before, Akala Island offers a variety of geological features, including a volcano, fishing spots, and even waterfalls!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2b_3
TEXT: I like to take a stroll when my mind gets mired in a problem, and it sounds like Akala Island would be a great place for that.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2b_4
TEXT: In that spirit, why don’t you take a stroll yourself? I’ll be here when you get back.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2c_0
TEXT: So you’re interested in Ula’Ula Island, eh? No surprise there—it’s one of my favorites as well.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2c_1
TEXT: Though perhaps that isn’t saying much... They’re all my favorites, really! Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2c_2
TEXT: As we’ve discussed, Ula’Ula Island is home to Mount Lanakila, the highest peak in all of Alola! But did you know the summit of Mount Lanakila also houses Alola’s very own Pokémon League?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2c_3
TEXT: It’s a place many Trainers aspire to reach, and doing so requires forging powerful bonds with Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2c_4
TEXT: In that spirit, why don’t you head out and find some new Pokémon partners, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2d_0
TEXT: So you’re interested in Poni Island, eh? No surprise there—it’s one of my favorites as well.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2d_1
TEXT: Though perhaps that isn’t saying much... They’re all my favorites, really! Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2d_2
TEXT: Did you know that Poni Island is home to the Battle Tree, Alola’s preeminent battle facility? Strong Trainers gather there to test their teams against each other.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2d_3
TEXT: I’ve heard you can even meet some Pokémon League Champions there on occasion! The things I could learn from them...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2d_4
TEXT: In the spirit of Poni Island—and as an act of public service—why don’t you test your battling skills against Team GO Rocket, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_3_1
TEXT: I don’t know about you, but I’ve had a great time getting to learn more about Alola, its Pokémon, and even its guardian deities.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_3_2
TEXT: If there’s one thing I love about Pokémon, it’s that there’s always something new to learn!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_3_3
TEXT: But to be honest with you, I was hoping we’d have a better idea by now of what attracted Alola’s guardian deities here.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_3_4
TEXT: They usually spend their time protecting Alola, so what could’ve spurred them to come here?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_3_5
TEXT: Could it be that they sensed something dangerous nearby that may threaten Alola? It would have to be something extraordinary—maybe even beyond our current understanding of Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_3_6
TEXT: Another daunting yet fascinating question for us to tackle together, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_3_7
TEXT: Whatever comes next, I know the two of us will overcome it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_3_8
TEXT: For now, continue your island research. I’ll keep trying to spot the guardian deities!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_3_9
TEXT: I’ll be in touch again soon. For now, let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_3a_0
TEXT: Welcome back! Did your friends like their Gifts?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_3b_0
TEXT: Welcome back! How was your adventure? Did you see anything new? You’ll have to tell me all about it!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_3c_0
TEXT: Welcome back! Let me take a look at the Pokémon you’ve returned with... I bet with some training, you and your Pokémon would be ready to take on Alola’s Pokémon League yourselves!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_3d_0

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_0_0

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_0_1
TEXT: I have something exciting planned for you today—you could even say it’s a mega surprise! Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_0_2
TEXT: I still have a few loose ends to wrap up, though.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_0_3
TEXT: While I finish my preparations, how about you take a quick survey of the area and see what Pokémon are out and about today?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_0_4
TEXT: I’ll be ready by the time you’re back.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1_0
TEXT: Ah, good—you’re back. I’ve just finished getting everything ready.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1_1
TEXT: Have you tried to Mega Evolve a Pokémon lately?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1_2
TEXT: Something about Mega Evolution caught my attention recently, so I was hoping you could help me investigate.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1_3
TEXT: Let’s take a closer look at Mega Evolution, from beginning to end.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1_4
TEXT: First, let’s choose which of these Pokémon you’d like to be the star of our research, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1_5
TEXT: Once we’re done, our understanding of Mega Evolution will be second to none.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1a_0
TEXT: So, you’ve chosen Venusaur, the Seed Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1a_1
TEXT: Venusaur absorbs solar energy as nutrition. By spreading the broad petals of its flower and catching the sun’s rays, it fills its body with power.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1a_2
TEXT: While I fetch Venusaur, how about you go out and catch a few Pokémon as a warm-up. Don’t forget to power them up, too.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1a_3
TEXT: You’ll have an even more formidable team by your side in no time!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1b_0
TEXT: So, you’ve chosen Charizard, the Flame Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1b_1
TEXT: Its bond with its Trainer is the source of its power. It boasts speed and maneuverability greater than that of a jet fighter.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1b_2
TEXT: While I fetch Charizard, how about you go out and catch a few Pokémon as a warm-up. Don’t forget to power them up, too.

TEXT: You’ll have an even more formidable team by your side in no time!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1c_0
TEXT: So, you’ve chosen Blastoise, the Shellfish Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1c_1
TEXT: The jets of water it spouts from the rocket cannons on its shell can punch through thick steel.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1c_2
TEXT: While I fetch Blastoise, how about you go out and catch a few Pokémon as a warm-up. Don’t forget to power them up, too.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_2a_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! Now that we’re fully warmed up, let’s tuck into our research on Mega Evolution.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_2a_1
TEXT: Some theorize that a strong bond between a Trainer and a Pokémon is the key to Mega Evolution. We’ve also seen that Mega Energy can play a role.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_2a_2
TEXT: However, I noticed recently that if you Mega Evolve your Pokémon once using Mega Energy, you won’t need to use Mega Energy to Mega Evolve that Pokémon again.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_0_1
TEXT: I’m feeling especially refreshed today, as if a pleasant island breeze was following me. Maybe it’s the freshly squeezed Pinap Juice I had for breakfast?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_3_2
TEXT: I wonder why Tapu Koko is here. Tapu Koko is said to be a Pokémon brimming with curiosity—but, naturally, island guardians tend to stay on their respective islands. The fact that one of them is here may mean something is amiss...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_3_4
TEXT: Do you think we’ll get a chance to meet the other island guardians, %PLAYERNAME%? Wouldn’t that be something.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_0_0
TEXT: Oh, %PLAYERNAME%! Great to see you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_0_1
TEXT: Your timing is impeccable. Because you know what? I’ve had enough!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_0_2
TEXT: That’s right—I’ve had enough of waiting to see a guardian deity. Everyone but me has managed to glimpse one out of pure serendipity, so I’ve decided to be proactive and embark on a search for Tapu Fini!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_0_3
TEXT: Do you think you could lend me a hand? With you involved, I think my chance of success will skyrocket.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_0_4
TEXT: Tapu Fini is the guardian deity of Poni Island in the Alola region.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_0_5
TEXT: Terrible calamities sometimes befall those who recklessly approach Tapu Fini, so I’m going to think very carefully about how we can successfully—and safely—track it down.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_0_6
TEXT: In the meantime, can you see what Team GO Rocket is up to? I’d like to avoid any complications in our search.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_1_1
TEXT: I’ve been busy researching Tapu Fini. My sources say that it can manipulate water, and it lives deep within a thick fog.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_1_2
TEXT: With that in mind, I’d hazard a guess that we’ll have the most luck uncovering Tapu Fini’s whereabouts if we look in places where other Water-type Pokémon are appearing.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_1_3
TEXT: I’ll start by visiting every foggy lake I can find. I can hear Blanche’s water safety spiel already...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_1_4
TEXT: But, personally speaking, a bit of risk is worth it if I finally get to see an island guardian with my own eyes! You remember to be careful, too, okay?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_1_5
TEXT: Now, let’s get back out there!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_2_0

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_2_1

TEXT: You should head out and see if you can catch a glimpse of Tapu Fini yourself!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_3_0
TEXT: Phew! Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%. How’d you fare?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_3_1
TEXT: You saw Tapu Fini as well?! That’s fantastic!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_3_2
TEXT: Now you’ve seen all four of Alola’s guardian deities. And I’ve seen...all of one.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_3_3
TEXT: That’s... Well, it’s one more than I’d seen before, isn’t it!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_3_4
TEXT: Just have to stay positive. No use feeling jealous of others’ good fortune...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_3_5
TEXT: Now that we know all the island guardians are nearby, we should look into why they’ve appeared here.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_3_6
TEXT: Were the cause some unsavory act on our part, I think they would have confronted us directly by now—but instead, we’ve been the ones tracking them down.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_3_7
TEXT: It’s certainly possible their motives have nothing to do with us. Though I have to assume they’re investigating the area for a reason.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_3_8
TEXT: But what could that reason be? I suppose all we can do for now is wait and see what happens.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_1_4
TEXT: When their skin gets wrinkled from moisture, they head for volcanoes and lie flat on a spot with a lot of geothermal heat to dry themselves out.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_0_0
TEXT: *yawn* Hello, %PLAYERNAME%... You’ll have to forgive my appearance, I was up late last night studying some nearby Rowlet. For as sleepy as they can be during the day, they sure perk right up at night!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_0_1
TEXT: Maybe it’d help me relax if I had a soft, cute Pokémon to hug... Like Stufful!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_0_2
TEXT: Stufful has an adorable appearance, but it hates to be hugged or touched in any way. Which is a shame because I’ve heard its fur is a delight to pet!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_0_3
TEXT: I wonder if I’ll ever get the chance to snuggle one—for science, of course! Maybe you could bring me a Stufful, %PLAYERNAME%? Just to look at!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_1_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, you’re back! And you’ve brought a Stufful with you! It looks so soft and fluffy...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_1_1
TEXT: Er-hem! Despite their looks, Stufful are incredibly dangerous Pokémon. A touch from anyone except a known friend sends Stufful into a surging frenzy!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_1_2
TEXT: For both our sakes, maybe we’d better befriend it before we try to cuddle—I mean, continue our research, don’t you think? Why not try feeding Stufful a Berry or two, %PLAYERNAME%. Perhaps we can get closer to it that way.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_2_0
TEXT: Your Stufful seems friendlier already, %PLAYERNAME%! Speaking of friendly, have you heard that its Evolution—Bewear—has the habit of hugging its companions?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_2_1
TEXT: Once Bewear accepts you as a friend, it tries to show its affection with a hug. But letting it do that is dangerous—it could easily shatter your bones!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_2_2
TEXT: Many Trainers have left this world after their spines were squashed by its hug...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_2_3
TEXT: While I don’t recommend you go hugging a Bewear anytime soon, there isn’t any harm in trying to meet one! Why don’t you evolve Stufful, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_3_0
TEXT: What a strong-looking Bewear you’ve come back with, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_3_1
TEXT: What’s that? You say I look a bit more frazzled than usual? Well...I may have tried to pet Stufful while you were away, and its flailing sent me flying so far someone could’ve mistaken me for a bird Pokémon. Haha—ow...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_3_2
TEXT: On the bright side, I did get to both pet Stufful and experience its strength firsthand! Come to think of it, I have a colleague studying Pokémon moves who’d love to hear all about this...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_3_3
TEXT: I hope you’ve had more luck bonding with your new Stufful and Bewear companions, %PLAYERNAME%. I think I’m going to bow out and grab an ice pack...or six. Thanks for all your help today! Take care, I’ll be in touch!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_1_5
TEXT: Let’s start with Tapu Bulu, guardian deity of Ula’Ula Island.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_3_2
TEXT: Those are all things Tapu Bulu is known for, you know.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_3_4
