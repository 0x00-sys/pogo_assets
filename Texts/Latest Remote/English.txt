RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_af2022_2_3
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%? Is it really you?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_af2022_2_4
TEXT: Oh, thank goodness. I’ve had the most befuddling day.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_af2022_2_5
TEXT: The Pokémon in the area were behaving strangely, so, as always, I turned to you to help me find out why—but to my confusion, you just stared at me blankly and bit straight into a Nanab Berry!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_af2022_2_6
TEXT: The next thing I knew, “you” had transformed into a Ditto! Or perhaps I have that backwards? Whatever the case, it seems that all the oddly behaving Pokémon I’ve seen today were in fact Ditto in disguise.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_af2022_2_7
TEXT: Hm? You noticed it too, did you?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_af2022_2_8
TEXT: And you saw a Ditto that had transformed to look like me? Incredible!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_af2022_2_9
TEXT: As you’ve experienced, Ditto have the fascinating ability to reconstitute their entire cellular structure to transform into whatever they see.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_0_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%! Wonderful to see you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_0_1
TEXT: You may know this already, but some Pokémon have different forms depending on the region they appear in, like Geodude. In most places, Geodude are described as being very similar to rocks—so much so that many Trainers mistake them for boulders.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_0_2
TEXT: Uniquely, the Geodude found in Alola are Rock- and Electric-type, while the Geodude found in Kanto are Rock- and Ground-type. Fascinating, don't you think?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_0_3
TEXT: You know, if you accidentally step on an Alolan Geodude, you'll hear a crunching sound and feel a shock ripple through your entire body.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_0_4
TEXT: I’d read about this phenomenon some time ago, but I was, er, “lucky” enough to experience it myself earlier today. Suffice it to say it left me feeling electrified!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_0_5
TEXT: Why don’t you head out to find some Alolan Geodude for yourself? Just make sure to watch your step!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! I see you had no trouble finding Alolan Geodude.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_1_1
TEXT: When Alolan Geodude evolves into Alolan Graveler, it becomes even more impressive. Alolan Graveler’s food of choice is a mineral called dravite. After eating it, crystals form inside the Pokémon, rising to the surface in some parts of its body.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_1_2
TEXT: Oh! And this fact’s my favorite: When two Alolan Graveler clash, it fills the surrounding area with flashes of light and sound. People call it the “fireworks of the earth”!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_1_3
TEXT: You know, I’d really like to see Alolan Graveler for myself. Think you can help me out, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_2_0
TEXT: Well done! That’s a mighty Alolan Graveler you’ve got there.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_2_1
TEXT: I’d love to see those “fireworks of the earth” for myself, but...maybe later. And much farther from my lab.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_2_2
TEXT: In any case! While you were away, I continued with some field research of my own. I saw the most curious thing—an Alolan Geodude flying through the air!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_2_3
TEXT: I suspect it was the work of Alolan Golem, the Evolution of Alolan Graveler. Alolan Golem can shoot large rocks that are charged with electricity. However, because it can’t fire boulders at a rapid pace, it’s been known to grab nearby Geodude and fire them instead.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_2_4
TEXT: Can you do some research to help me understand what I saw?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_3_0
TEXT: Ah, you’re back—and with an Alolan Golem!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_3_1
TEXT: Alolan Golem are known to be grumpy and stubborn. If you upset them, they discharge electricity from the surface of their bodies and let out a growl that sounds like thunder.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_3_2
TEXT: Between that and their penchant for launching Geodude in lieu of boulders, we’d best be careful around Alolan Golem.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_3_3
TEXT: You have an incredible knack for befriending Pokémon, though, so I’m sure you’ll be the best of pals in no time!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_3_4

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_0_3

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1_0

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1_1
TEXT: Have you tried to Mega Evolve a Pokémon lately?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1_2

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1_3
TEXT: Let’s take a closer look at Mega Evolution, from beginning to end.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1_4
TEXT: First, let’s choose which of these Pokémon you’d like to be the star of our research, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1_5
TEXT: Once we’re done, our understanding of Mega Evolution will be second to none.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1a_0
TEXT: So, you’ve chosen Venusaur, the Seed Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1a_1
TEXT: Venusaur absorbs solar energy as nutrition. By spreading the broad petals of its flower and catching the sun’s rays, it fills its body with power.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1a_2
TEXT: While I fetch Venusaur, how about you go out and catch a few Pokémon as a warm-up. Don’t forget to power them up, too.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1a_3
TEXT: You’ll have an even more formidable team by your side in no time!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1b_0
TEXT: So, you’ve chosen Charizard, the Flame Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1b_1
TEXT: Its bond with its Trainer is the source of its power. It boasts speed and maneuverability greater than that of a jet fighter.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1b_2

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1c_0
TEXT: So, you’ve chosen Blastoise, the Shellfish Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1c_1

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_2a_0

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_2a_1

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_2a_2

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_0_1
TEXT: I’m feeling especially refreshed today, as if a pleasant island breeze was following me. Maybe it’s the freshly squeezed Pinap Juice I had for breakfast?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_3_2
TEXT: I wonder why Tapu Koko is here. Tapu Koko is said to be a Pokémon brimming with curiosity—but, naturally, island guardians tend to stay on their respective islands. The fact that one of them is here may mean something is amiss...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_3_4
TEXT: Do you think we’ll get a chance to meet the other island guardians, %PLAYERNAME%? Wouldn’t that be something.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_0_0
TEXT: Hello, %PLAYERNAME%! You’ve caught me at a curious time. You see, I was just out for a walk, thinking about how much I’d love to see a Mudkip, when—wouldn’t you know it—I came across a whole mess of them!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_0_1
TEXT: Did you know that Mudkip sleep by burying themselves in soil at the water’s edge? Sounds adorable, right?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_0_2
TEXT: One of the many things that’s always impressed me about Mudkip is how strong it is in spite of its size.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_0_3
TEXT: When faced with a tight situation in battle, Mudkip will unleash its amazing power. It can even crush rocks much bigger than itself!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_0_4
TEXT: It would be less than ideal if all these Mudkip were to do that right now... And yet, the researcher in me is curious to see it happen! Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_0_5
TEXT: Anyway, what do you say we do a bit of research on Mudkip, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%. I see you’ve brought a Mudkip with you—nice work!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_1_1
TEXT: Using the fin on its head, Mudkip senses the flow of water to keep track of what’s going on around it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_1_2
TEXT: I got a bit too close during my observations earlier, and those Mudkip splashed mud all over my coat! Which actually got me thinking about Mudkip’s Evolution, Marshtomp.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_1_3
TEXT: Living on muddy ground that provides poor footing has made Marshtomp’s legs sturdy.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_1_4
TEXT: And because it’s used to such slippery surfaces, Marshtomp can quickly overwhelm foes mired in mud.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_1_5
TEXT: While I clean my coat off, why don’t you try evolving your Mudkip so you can see Marshtomp firsthand, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_2_0
TEXT: I knew I should’ve brought an extra coat with me... Ah! Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%. That’s a very sturdy-looking Marshtomp you have with you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_2_1
TEXT: Don’t you think it’s inspiring how Pokémon thrive in all sorts of environments? Mudkip and Marshtomp seem like an especially versatile bunch.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_2_2
TEXT: Now, I have some exciting news. I caught a glimpse of some Swampert—Marshtomp’s Evolution—while you were away!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_2_3
TEXT: Swampert can not only break boulders into pieces with one swing of its arms, but it can also predict storms by sensing subtle differences in the sounds of waves and tidal winds with its fins!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_2_4
TEXT: I tend to get so engrossed in my research that I lose track of my surroundings, so having a Swampert around might be just what I need.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_2_5
TEXT: ...What’s that? I could just try to pay a bit more attention myself? Well, I suppose that’s an option... But not quite as fun, don’t you think? Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_2_6
TEXT: Why don’t you try evolving your Marshtomp, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_3_0
TEXT: Wow, %PLAYERNAME%! It’s hard to believe that Swampert of yours was once a tiny, adorable Mudkip. Pokémon really are incredible!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_3_1
TEXT: Swampert tend to make nests near beautiful beaches, and it’s strong enough to tow a large ship.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_3_2
TEXT: I guess you know which Pokémon to bring with you on your next beach vacation, eh?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_3_3
TEXT: You know, the last time I saw Mudkip appearing en masse like they are today, I also saw all manner of Trainers out exploring and researching, too.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_3_4
TEXT: It always fills me with joy to see everyone having fun with Pokémon. I hope you’ve enjoyed yourself today as well!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_3_5
TEXT: As for me, I think it’s time I stomp on home. I’ll be in touch!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_0_0
TEXT: Oh, %PLAYERNAME%! Great to see you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_0_1
TEXT: Your timing is impeccable. Because you know what? I’ve had enough!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_0_2
TEXT: That’s right—I’ve had enough of waiting to see a guardian deity. Everyone but me has managed to glimpse one out of pure serendipity, so I’ve decided to be proactive and embark on a search for Tapu Fini!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_0_3
TEXT: Do you think you could lend me a hand? With you involved, I think my chance of success will skyrocket.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_0_4
TEXT: Tapu Fini is the guardian deity of Poni Island in the Alola region.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_0_5
TEXT: Terrible calamities sometimes befall those who recklessly approach Tapu Fini, so I’m going to think very carefully about how we can successfully—and safely—track it down.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_0_6
TEXT: In the meantime, can you see what Team GO Rocket is up to? I’d like to avoid any complications in our search.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_1_1
TEXT: I’ve been busy researching Tapu Fini. My sources say that it can manipulate water, and it lives deep within a thick fog.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_1_2
TEXT: With that in mind, I’d hazard a guess that we’ll have the most luck uncovering Tapu Fini’s whereabouts if we look in places where other Water-type Pokémon are appearing.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_1_3
TEXT: I’ll start by visiting every foggy lake I can find. I can hear Blanche’s water safety spiel already...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_1_4
TEXT: But, personally speaking, a bit of risk is worth it if I finally get to see an island guardian with my own eyes! You remember to be careful, too, okay?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_1_5
TEXT: Now, let’s get back out there!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_2_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%! Can you believe it?!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_2_1
TEXT: I was knee-deep in the last lake I thought to check—shoes soggy, Dewpider on all sides—when I finally, FINALLY, saw Tapu Fini!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_2_2
TEXT: I’d love to tell you more about it, but I need to scribble down all the details in my journal while they’re fresh in my mind.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_2_3
TEXT: You should head out and see if you can catch a glimpse of Tapu Fini yourself!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_3_0
TEXT: Phew! Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%. How’d you fare?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_3_1
TEXT: You saw Tapu Fini as well?! That’s fantastic!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_3_2
TEXT: Now you’ve seen all four of Alola’s guardian deities. And I’ve seen...all of one.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_3_3
TEXT: That’s... Well, it’s one more than I’d seen before, isn’t it!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_3_4
TEXT: Just have to stay positive. No use feeling jealous of others’ good fortune...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_3_5
TEXT: Now that we know all the island guardians are nearby, we should look into why they’ve appeared here.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_3_6
TEXT: Were the cause some unsavory act on our part, I think they would have confronted us directly by now—but instead, we’ve been the ones tracking them down.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_3_7
TEXT: It’s certainly possible their motives have nothing to do with us. Though I have to assume they’re investigating the area for a reason.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_3_8
TEXT: But what could that reason be? I suppose all we can do for now is wait and see what happens.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_0_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%! How have you been? Finding time to relax, I hope? Perhaps with your Pokémon?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_0_1
TEXT: I’m enjoying a bit of a productivity boom, myself, but it’s made me realize that my research has gone uninterrupted for quite some time.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_0_2
TEXT: I fear there may be trouble brewing—specifically from Team GO Rocket. They’ve been too quiet for too long, don’t you think?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_0_3
TEXT: Would you mind patrolling the area to see if anything’s amiss?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_1_0
TEXT: Well done, %PLAYERNAME%. As much as I wish they’d give us a break, I know Team GO Rocket never rests—so neither can we!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_1_1
TEXT: I’m relieved to see you’ve rescued a couple of Shadow Pokémon from them already.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_1_2
TEXT: As both a professor and as someone who loves Pokémon, I can’t stand idly by as Team GO Rocket mistreats so many innocent Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_1_3
TEXT: Let’s get back out there and rescue some more Pokémon from them!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_2_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! Thanks for handling those Team GO Rocket Grunts. You and your Pokémon have done a great job of scaring them off, as usual!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_2_1
TEXT: They’ll think twice before showing up around here again, I suspect.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_2_2
TEXT: But those Shadow Pokémon they’ve left behind... Well, at least they’re safe with us now.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_2_3
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, let’s purify them so they can put their terrible time with Team GO Rocket in the past. I know they’ll be grateful for your help!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_3_0
TEXT: Those Pokémon are looking much better now, %PLAYERNAME%. I’m sure they’re relieved to be with a Trainer like you and away from Team GO Rocket.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_3_1
TEXT: Now that we’ve cleared out some of their underlings, I think we’d better track down the Team GO Rocket Leaders.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_3_2
TEXT: Based on how you handled those Grunts, I’m sure the Leaders won’t stand a chance!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_4_0
TEXT: You’ve done it, %PLAYERNAME%! Once again, you’ve been instrumental in stopping Team GO Rocket from getting their way.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_4_1
TEXT: It’s a privilege to watch you and your partners grow together and use your strength to help Pokémon everywhere.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_4_2
TEXT: Now. We’ve neutralized the Team GO Rocket Leaders, so it’s time to let Giovanni know that we’re not going to let him carry out his plan unchallenged.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_4_3
TEXT: I know he’s tough—but you’re tougher. I have the utmost confidence in you, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_5_0
TEXT: Incredible work, %PLAYERNAME%! You and your Pokémon have an impressive bond—one that Team GO Rocket will never be able match.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_5_1
TEXT: Pokémon everywhere are fortunate to have you on their side!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_5_2
TEXT: I know it won’t be long before Team GO Rocket appears with another scheme, but I can rest a bit easier knowing that you’re here to stop them right in their tracks.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_5_3
TEXT: For now, though, get some rest. You’ve more than earned it!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_1_4
TEXT: When their skin gets wrinkled from moisture, they head for volcanoes and lie flat on a spot with a lot of geothermal heat to dry themselves out.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_0_0
TEXT: *yawn* Hello, %PLAYERNAME%... You’ll have to forgive my appearance, I was up late last night studying some nearby Rowlet. For as sleepy as they can be during the day, they sure perk right up at night!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_0_1
TEXT: Maybe it’d help me relax if I had a soft, cute Pokémon to hug... Like Stufful!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_0_2
TEXT: Stufful has an adorable appearance, but it hates to be hugged or touched in any way. Which is a shame because I’ve heard its fur is a delight to pet!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_0_3
TEXT: I wonder if I’ll ever get the chance to snuggle one—for science, of course! Maybe you could bring me a Stufful, %PLAYERNAME%? Just to look at!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_1_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, you’re back! And you’ve brought a Stufful with you! It looks so soft and fluffy...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_1_1
TEXT: Er-hem! Despite their looks, Stufful are incredibly dangerous Pokémon. A touch from anyone except a known friend sends Stufful into a surging frenzy!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_1_2
TEXT: For both our sakes, maybe we’d better befriend it before we try to cuddle—I mean, continue our research, don’t you think? Why not try feeding Stufful a Berry or two, %PLAYERNAME%. Perhaps we can get closer to it that way.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_2_0
TEXT: Your Stufful seems friendlier already, %PLAYERNAME%! Speaking of friendly, have you heard that its Evolution—Bewear—has the habit of hugging its companions?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_2_1
TEXT: Once Bewear accepts you as a friend, it tries to show its affection with a hug. But letting it do that is dangerous—it could easily shatter your bones!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_2_2
TEXT: Many Trainers have left this world after their spines were squashed by its hug...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_2_3
TEXT: While I don’t recommend you go hugging a Bewear anytime soon, there isn’t any harm in trying to meet one! Why don’t you evolve Stufful, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_3_0
TEXT: What a strong-looking Bewear you’ve come back with, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_3_1
TEXT: What’s that? You say I look a bit more frazzled than usual? Well...I may have tried to pet Stufful while you were away, and its flailing sent me flying so far someone could’ve mistaken me for a bird Pokémon. Haha—ow...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_3_2
TEXT: On the bright side, I did get to both pet Stufful and experience its strength firsthand! Come to think of it, I have a colleague studying Pokémon moves who’d love to hear all about this...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_3_3
TEXT: I hope you’ve had more luck bonding with your new Stufful and Bewear companions, %PLAYERNAME%. I think I’m going to bow out and grab an ice pack...or six. Thanks for all your help today! Take care, I’ll be in touch!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_0_1
TEXT: Your timing is excellent. I’ve hit a bit of a roadblock in my research!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_0_2
TEXT: You see, I’m still puzzling over the guardian deities both Spark and Blanche have seen recently. I’ve yet to suss out why they’ve been appearing.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_0_3
TEXT: I can only hope they’re not angry with us—or worse!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_0_4
TEXT: I think I’ll take a break in the shade to clear my mind. It’s important to give your brain a breather now and then!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_0_5
TEXT: Why don’t you head out to find some shade for yourself, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! I see you’ve found some leafy Pokémon to rest under.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_1_1
TEXT: Are you feeling refreshed? I know I am!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_1_2
TEXT: While you were out, I thought of a new angle for our investigation.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_1_3
TEXT: As you may know, Alola is home to four guardian deities. We’ve seen two, so it stands to reason the other two may be buzzing about already.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_1_4
TEXT: Instead of waiting for them to come to us, I think we should get out and search for them ourselves.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_1_5
TEXT: Let’s start with Tapu Bulu, guardian deity of Ula’Ula Island.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_1_6
TEXT: Ula’Ula Island is a rugged locale, home to Mount Lanakila, the highest peak in Alola.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_1_7
TEXT: Tapu Bulu is said to make ringing sounds with its tail to let others know where it is and avoid unneeded conflicts. Knowing that, it shouldn’t be too hard to find!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_1_8
TEXT: In addition, I know Tapu Bulu can help plants grow, so perhaps we’ll have some luck if we begin by looking for Pokémon that are known to grow. Let’s get out there, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_2_0
TEXT: Ah, %PLAYERNAME%—you’re back. How did your search go?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_2_1
TEXT: I asked Candela to lend us a hand shortly after you left.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_2_2
TEXT: And just a few minutes later, before I’d even finished packing my gear, she came running back saying she’d heard a ringing in the air and looked up to see Tapu Bulu floating by!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_2_3
TEXT: Yet another guardian deity I’ve missed by a hair... Such is the fickle nature of Pokémon research, I suppose.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_2_4
TEXT: I’m glad you’ve at least been more successful, %PLAYERNAME%. Now that we know it’s out there, let’s double down on our search for Tapu Bulu!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_2_5
TEXT: I’ll speak with Candela to see if she might know any more details that could help us.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_3_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%—you saw Tapu Bulu, didn’t you!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_3_1
TEXT: What was it like? Tell me everything! Did you hear a ringing noise? Did you see it making vegetation grow, or maybe even swinging large trees around by their roots?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_3_2
TEXT: Those are all things Tapu Bulu is known for, you know.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_3_3
TEXT: As you might’ve expected, I was—yet again—unable to witness Tapu Bulu myself. I did, however, think up a new theory.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_3_4
TEXT: The guardian deities seem to be keeping a relatively low profile. Perhaps they’re just here to investigate something—or even help us somehow.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_3_5
TEXT: Things may become clearer if we see Tapu Fini, the last of Alola’s guardian deities.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_3_6
