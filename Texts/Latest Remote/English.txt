RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I think I’ve got an exciting adventure for you. I’ve been working on something...BIG.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_0_1
TEXT: Recently, we observed a large number of Weedle appearing in the wild. I wanted to investigate that phenomenon further.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_0_2
TEXT: After a day of research, I saw something sparkling in the tall grass near where the Weedle were gathering.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_0_3
TEXT: It turned out to be a smooth, stonelike object with a symbol etched into it. It glowed with an energy I’ve never encountered before!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_0_4
TEXT: I’d seen that symbol before in documents about Mega Evolution that I received from my colleague in Kalos, Professor Sycamore. That led me to believe that the object was somehow related.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_0_5
TEXT: After digging further into the documents, I theorized that Pokémon can Mega Evolve using the energy from the object I found, which I named Mega Energy.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_0_6
TEXT: It also occurred to me that the object I found might be related to Weedle.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_0_7
TEXT: Now that I’ve caught you up on my BIG discovery, let’s get started on some research. We’ll need a Weedle—I think that Pokémon has mega potential!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_1_0
TEXT: Great work, %PLAYERNAME%! Let’s document our findings for other Trainers.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_1_1
TEXT: Now, Weedle can’t Mega Evolve, but its final Evolution, Beedrill, can.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_1_2
TEXT: My theory is that there is Mega Energy for different Pokémon and that each Pokémon needs a certain amount of Mega Energy to Mega Evolve.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_1_3
TEXT: It also seems that Mega-Evolved Pokémon return to normal once their Mega Energy is depleted.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_1_4
TEXT: It may be difficult to gather the Mega Energy needed to Mega Evolve a Pokémon for the first time. However, it seems that once a Pokémon has Mega Evolved, it requires less Mega Energy to do so again.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_1_5
TEXT: Maybe it’s because Mega Evolution strengthens a Trainer’s bond with their Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_1_6
TEXT: Let’s continue this investigation. How about you evolve your Weedle to its final Evolution and see whether you can find enough Mega Energy to Mega Evolve your new Beedrill.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_2_0
TEXT: Again, you never cease to amaze me, %PLAYERNAME%. I think you and Beedrill are going to be great partners.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_2_1
TEXT: I’ve learned that some other Pokémon can Mega Evolve, too.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_2_2
TEXT: While I’ve been able to confirm only a few, I’m sure we’ll discover more in time. At this point, you should be able to Mega Evolve your Beedrill, if you’re ready.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_2_3
TEXT: Now, I’m sure you are going to ask, “Professor Willow, how do I get Mega Energy for other Pokémon?”

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_2_4
TEXT: Well, don’t worry, Trainer. Mega Venusaur, Mega Charizard, and Mega Blastoise are appearing in Mega Raids all around the world. It appears you can get Mega Energy by challenging those Mega-Evolved Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_2_5
TEXT: Why don’t you Mega Evolve your Beedrill and battle with it in Mega Raids? There seem to be benefits to battling in raids alongside Mega-Evolved Pokémon for both you and your fellow Trainers.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_2_6
TEXT: I’m curious to see what effect Mega-Evolved Pokémon have on other Pokémon when they battle together. Why don’t you give it a try!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_3_0
TEXT: I dare say, this was a successful research project! It looks like you were able to acquire some Mega Energy by battling those Mega-Evolved Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_3_1
TEXT: I’ve documented that you and your Mega-Evolved Pokémon can do many other things together, too.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_3_2
TEXT: I hope to see you and your Mega-Evolved Pokémon battling at Gyms, challenging other Trainers, combating Team GO Rocket, and, of course, taking some snapshots to send back to yours truly.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_3_3
TEXT: Mega-Evolved Pokémon are extremely powerful, so I think it’s best that we don’t bring our new friends into the GO Battle League just yet, at least until more research is done.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_3_4
TEXT: I wanted to give you a token of my appreciation for all your hard work on this project—a Mega Bracelet!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_3_5
TEXT: In other regions, Trainers use Mega Bracelets to help their Pokémon Mega Evolve. Based on my research into Mega Energy, it seems you won’t need a Mega Bracelet to Mega Evolve your Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_3_6
TEXT: However, I thought a Mega Bracelet would be a trendy way to show off your Mega Evolution skills.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_3_7
TEXT: You can check it out when you want to change up your look. I hope you accept this gift with my sincerest thanks for a job well done.
