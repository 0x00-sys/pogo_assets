RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_0_0
TEXT: Hi there, %PLAYERNAME%. I can’t help but be impressed by your progress. You’ve done fantastic work in researching Pokémon originally discovered in the Kanto, Johto, Hoenn, and Sinnoh regions.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_0_1
TEXT: Now that we’ve researched Pokémon that were found in those regions...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_0_2
TEXT: let’s take a closer look at Pokémon originally discovered in the Unova region!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_0_3
TEXT: I think it’s fascinating that even though we know a lot about Pokémon from all over the world, there’s always more to learn!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_0_4
TEXT: Speaking of discoveries, I’ve been doing some additional research and heard about an interesting phenomenon that has to do with Meowth in the Galar region.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_0_5
TEXT: I was speaking to a researcher who’s the granddaughter of a colleague from Galar, and she shared some intriguing information.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_0_6
TEXT: It seems that Galarian Meowth lived with seafaring people, which toughened their bodies so much that parts of them turned to iron.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_0_7
TEXT: Maybe I could get a few workout tips—I’ve been looking for some ways to toughen up myself!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_0_8
TEXT: Anyway...let’s do some more research on Pokémon originally discovered in Unova, but be sure to keep your eyes open for other exciting discoveries.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_1_0
TEXT: Wonderful work, Trainer. You might be familiar with the tradition in which a Pokémon Trainer selects their very first partner from a group of three Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_1_1
TEXT: These first-partner Pokémon are normally Fire, Water, or Grass types. In Unova, many Trainers choose the Water-type Oshawott as their first-partner Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_1_2
TEXT: This Sea Otter Pokémon is known to use the scalchop on its stomach during battle. Isn’t that just adorable? Please continue your research, and let me know your findings.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_2_0
TEXT: I can’t stop thinking about how cute Oshawott is— Oh! You’re back! Excellent work catching that Patrat!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_2_1
TEXT: Now that we’ve researched the Water-type first-partner Pokémon of many Unovan Trainers, let’s shift focus to the Fire-type one—Tepig!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_2_2
TEXT: I’m a particular fan of Tepig because it uses the fireballs that come from its nose to roast Berries. It’s such a clever use of an ability.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_2_3
TEXT: I just love roasted Pinap Berries! We should continue our work and see what else we can discover.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_3_0
TEXT: Being the savvy Trainer you are, I’m sure you know which type of Pokémon we’re going to research next.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_3_1
TEXT: That’s right—Grass type! In Unova, many Trainers choose Snivy, the Grass Snake Pokémon, as their first partner. Snivy is intelligent and calm, and being exposed to lots of sunlight makes it move more swiftly.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_3_2
TEXT: Perhaps there’s a lot we could learn from such a sagacious Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_3_3
TEXT: Anyway, let’s get started on these research tasks. Be sure to listen carefully, as you never know what you might encounter!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_4_0
TEXT: You’re a natural, %PLAYERNAME%. I’m so glad we could research some of the amazing Pokémon originally discovered in the Unova region.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_4_1
TEXT: I can’t thank you enough for your hard work. I hope you put this Charged TM and Fast TM to good use!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_4_2
TEXT: By the way, I literally stumbled across a mysterious Pokémon I’ve never encountered before.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_4_3
TEXT: I think you’re the perfect Trainer to take this Pokémon and help it reach its potential. Best of luck, and I’ll be in touch soon!
