RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_0_2

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_1_0
TEXT: Great work with your research on Eevee, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_1_1
TEXT: According to my findings, Eevee’s irregular DNA gives it the ability to evolve into many different Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_1_2
TEXT: For example, it has three Evolutions originally discovered in the Kanto region: the Water-type Vaporeon, the Electric-type Jolteon, and the Fire-type Flareon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_1_3
TEXT: Isn’t it fascinating that Eevee can evolve into Pokémon of such different types?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_1_4
TEXT: As you work on your Eevee research, perhaps you might learn more about these Pokémon. Good luck!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_2_0

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_2_1
TEXT: These incredible creatures are capable of some impressive feats.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_2_2
TEXT: Did you know that Vaporeon can melt away into water?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_2_3
TEXT: Or that Jolteon can blast out 10,000-volt lightning bolts?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_2_4
TEXT: And that Flareon breathes fire that is over 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_2_5
TEXT: Isn’t it amazing that all three of these Pokémon evolve from Eevee?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_2_6
TEXT: Perhaps there’s something besides genetics that gives Eevee so much potential.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_2_7
TEXT: Let’s do some more research to learn more about Eevee. At certain times of the day, this Pokémon can evolve into Pokémon originally discovered in the Johto region: the Psychic-type Espeon and the Dark-type Umbreon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_2_8
TEXT: If you keep up your research, you might find them as well!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_3_0
TEXT: Great work, %PLAYERNAME%! Looks like you’ve gotten yourself an Espeon and an Umbreon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_3_1
TEXT: The Psychic-type Espeon can use the fine hair on its body to sense air currents and predict its enemies’ next move. It usually evolves from Eevee during the daytime.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_3_2
TEXT: As for the Dark-type Umbreon, it evolves from Eevee during the nighttime. It’s said that Umbreon’s rings glow yellow under the full moon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_3_3
TEXT: Who would’ve thought that something like the time of day could affect Pokémon Evolution!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_3_4
TEXT: It’s wonderful to delve even deeper into the mysteries of Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_3_5
TEXT: Let’s keep it up by researching Eevee’s Evolutions that were originally discovered in the Sinnoh region.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_3_6
TEXT: The Grass-type Leafeon and Ice-type Glaceon seem to have evolved in order to adapt to their environment.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_3_7
TEXT: Why don’t you research these Pokémon next?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_4_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, welcome back!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_4_1
TEXT: I see you’ve managed to get a Leafeon and a Glaceon! Congratulations!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_4_2
TEXT: The vastly different environments in the Sinnoh region appear to have caused the adaptable Eevee to evolve into a Grass-type Pokémon and an Ice-type Pokémon. It’s inspiring to see how resilient this little Pokémon can be!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_4_3
TEXT: We might not uncover all the secrets of Pokémon Evolution today, but I think we can learn a lot about ourselves through Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_4_4
TEXT: Researching Eevee today has taught me there are so many paths in life to choose from.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_4_5
TEXT: I hope that Eevee can inspire you to find the one that suits you best.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_4_6
TEXT: But enough of this professor’s ramblings. Eevee is known to have just one more Evolution—the Fairy-type Sylveon, which was originally discovered in the Kalos region.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_4_7
TEXT: This Pokémon has ribbonlike feelers that it uses to calm others. Sylveon evolves from Eevee when it reaches a certain level of friendship and trust with its beloved Trainer. Knowing that almost brings a tear to my eye!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_4_8
TEXT: I hope you have the good fortune of crossing paths with a wonderful Pokémon like Sylveon sometime soon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_4_9
TEXT: Until then, let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_oshat_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I’m hoping you can help me with something. You see, I was out for a walk recently and noticed several trees covered in slash marks—and I think I know what made them.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_oshat_0_1
TEXT: There’s a Pokémon called Oshawott—the Sea Otter Pokémon—that keeps a scalchop on its stomach that it can detach and use as a blade. I’ve seen a lot of Oshawott around lately, so I’m thinking they may be our mystery tree carvers.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_oshat_0_2
TEXT: Could you catch some Oshawott so we can learn more about them?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_oshat_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! Did you know that Oshawott uses the scalchop on its stomach not only to fight, but also to break open hard berries? Gotta love a good multitool.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_oshat_1_1
TEXT: Now that we’ve learned more about Oshawott, I was hoping we could turn our attention to its Evolution, Dewott. Don’t let its cute appearance fool you—Dewott takes itself very seriously.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_oshat_1_2
TEXT: Also known as the Discipline Pokémon, Dewott uses strict training to learn its flowing double-scalchop technique. I’d love to see Dewott’s fighting in action! Can you evolve your Oshawott for me, Trainer?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_oshat_2_0
TEXT: Wow, Dewott’s double-scalchop technique is incredible! Pokémon truly never cease to amaze, eh, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_oshat_2_1
TEXT: I barely have the coordination to rub my tummy and pat my head at the same time, and here we have Pokémon mastering bespoke battle techniques. It’s inspiring stuff!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_oshat_2_2
TEXT: I think I’ve gained a better understanding of Dewott—which means we can begin studying its Evolution.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_oshat_2_3
TEXT: Dewott’s Evolution, Samurott, is known to wield swords called seamitars incorporated in its armor. Apparently, Samurott can draw and sheathe its seamitars in the time it takes a foe to blink.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_oshat_2_4
TEXT: Not hard to see why it’s known as the Formidable Pokémon! Why don’t you evolve Dewott so we can witness Samurott’s majesty for ourselves?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_oshat_3_0
TEXT: Excellent work, Trainer! That’s a fine Samurott. Its seamitars truly are a sight to behold! Knowing how quickly it can draw and sheathe its blades, I wonder how fast it can dice up berries...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_oshat_3_1
TEXT: Thanks for all your help today, %PLAYERNAME%. We’ve learned so much about Oshawott, Dewott, and Samurott—and from them too! I’ll “sea” you next time! Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I’m glad you’re here. A new adventure is about to begin!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_0_1
TEXT: Not long ago, various Legendary Pokémon began emerging from mysterious rings that suddenly appeared in the sky. After some research, we discovered it was Hoopa, the Mischief Pokémon, that was responsible.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_0_2
TEXT: Hoopa’s rings allow it to teleport things—including itself—wherever it wants. That power makes it hard to track down, but for some reason, Hoopa seems to keep returning to this area.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_0_3
TEXT: How do I know? Well, I was doing some lab work recently when my glasses were lifted straight off my head. Spark was there assisting me, and he said he saw a small, lavender-colored hand emerge from a ring and snatch my glasses. Pretty bold, eh?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_0_4
TEXT: Luckily, he and Candela managed to retrieve my spectacles by chasing down the rings that were popping up at random around my mobile lab. So, at least I can still see. Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_0_5
TEXT: Needless to say, I’m still not sure why Hoopa’s here. Tracking it down has been difficult, but with your help, I’m sure we’ll crack the case in no time!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_0_6
TEXT: For now, why don’t you try using an Incense to see what Pokémon you can find in the area?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_1_0
TEXT: As with all great mysteries, solving this will take time, patience, and trust. I’ll need to work alone at some points, but I promise I’ll return to share my findings and help propel us forward.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_1_1
TEXT: You just keep exploring the world as you always do. You never know what you might find!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_1_2
TEXT: I’ll report back here once I have more information on Hoopa. Thanks in advance for your help, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_2_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! It’s so good to see you again. Have you managed to spot Hoopa anywhere?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_2_1
TEXT: Although some think of Hoopa as a mischievous troublemaker, really all it wants to do is have fun!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_2_2
TEXT: Speaking of fun, it seems Hoopa had a blast filling up my mobile lab with Pinap Berries. Maybe it spotted me happily digging into some during my lunch break and decided I could use a few more.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_2_3
TEXT: It was a bit of a surprise when I opened the lab door and piles of Pinap Berries poured out! It took a while to clean everything up—but my lab did smell amazing afterward, so it wasn’t all bad.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_2_4
TEXT: It was nice having an excuse to clean—not to mention I have enough Pinap Berries to last me for days. I might even make some jam...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_2_5
TEXT: Anyway, Hoopa sure has seemed a lot friendlier these days, hasn’t it? I think it’s been having lots of fun interacting with us. Maybe that’s why it’s been bringing all sorts of surprises into our world.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_2_6
TEXT: Who knows—you might be able to catch it now!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_3_0
TEXT: Wow, %PLAYERNAME%! I can't believe you caught Hoopa!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_3_1
TEXT: Normally I’d say we’re done with our research, but I wouldn’t be surprised if Hoopa continued to cause mischief.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_3_2
TEXT: It seems there’s still much for us to learn about this Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_3_3
TEXT: By the way, I’ve noticed that some Psychic-type Pokémon have been appearing around my lab. Could Hoopa’s presence be the cause?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_3_4
TEXT: Perhaps we’ll be able to use this as an opportunity to research Psychic-type Pokémon, including Hoopa. I’ll have to investigate this phenomenon further, and I’ll let you know when I’ve learned more. Until next time!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_4_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I’ve noticed an increase in the number of Psychic-type Pokémon appearing around my mobile lab of late.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_4_1
TEXT: Whenever something like this happens, I can’t help but get excited about researching the cause!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_4_2
TEXT: As you may recall, the Mythical Pokémon Hoopa is a Psychic and Ghost type. I have a hunch its recent appearances might be causing the uptick in Psychic-type Pokémon in these parts.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_4_3
TEXT: What’s more, I believe we may be able to learn more about Hoopa by researching other Psychic-type Pokémon. There’s one in particular that’s caught my attention: Inkay.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_4_4
TEXT: My colleague in the Kalos region told me that Inkay is known as the Revolving Pokémon, and that it evolves in a unique way.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_4_5
TEXT: I’m ashamed to say I’ve forgotten the details, but I do remember him saying “upside-down” several times during his explanation. If only I could remember why...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_4_6
TEXT: Maybe it’s my one-track mind speaking, but I immediately think of Hoopa when I hear “upside-down”—because its appearance turned our world right on its head! Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_5_0
TEXT: Hey, Trainer! Have you noticed that Hoopa has continued to cause mischief? Its tricks are always unexpected, but I do feel like Hoopa’s brought some welcome color to our lives.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_5_1
TEXT: Speaking of colorful things, I’ve heard reports that there’s a certain Pokémon nearby that’s known to have multiple appearances. Keep your eyes peeled for me, won’t you?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_5_2
TEXT: In the meantime, I’m going to analyze everything we’ve learned about Psychic-type Pokémon thus far. Hopefully it’ll point us in the right direction to continue our research on Pokémon forms—and Hoopa!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_0_3
TEXT: The first few times I saw it, I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me, but as the motions grew more frequent, I began to suspect a Pokémon was involved.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_0_1
TEXT: I was just thinking that it’d be interesting to research more about my Buddy Pokémon and the team leaders’ buddies.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_2_0
